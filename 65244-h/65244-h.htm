CRIMINAL ABORTION.</h2>

</div>

<p><i>By the Common Law and by many of our State Codes, fœtal life, per
se, is almost wholly ignored and its destruction unpunished</i>; abortion in
every case being considered an offence mainly against the mother, and as
such, unless fatal to her, a mere misdemeanor, or wholly disregarded.</p>

<p><i>By the Moral Law</i>, <span class="smcap">the wilful killing of a human being at any
stage of its existence is Murder</span>.</p>

<p>In undertaking the discussion at length of this subject, three preliminary
facts must be assumed:—</p>

<p><i>First.</i>—That if abortion be ever a crime, it is, of necessity, even in
isolated cases, one of no small interest to moralist, jurist, and physician;
and that when general and common, this interest is extended to the whole
community and fearfully enhanced.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i>—That if the latter assumption be true, both in premise and
conclusion, neglected as the crime has been by most ethical writers and
political economists, hastily passed over by medical jurists,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and confessedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
everywhere the great opprobrium of the law, often indeed by taunt
that of medicine, either it cannot in the nature of things be suppressed,
as by these facts implied, or its suppression has not been properly attempted.
Discarding the former of these alternatives as alike unworthy
of belief and proved false by facts hereafter to be shown, it will appear,</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i>—That the discussion now broached is neither supererogatory
nor out of place; further, that it is absolutely and necessarily demanded.</p>

<p>Moreover, in order that the importance and various bearings of the subject
may be better appreciated, and that the writer’s position and aims may
be more fairly understood, it must be borne in mind that there exist to
this discussion certain positive and apparent objections, which have, in a
measure, given rise to much of the silence and omission alluded to above,
and are, in the main, as follows:—</p>

<p>1. The natural dislike of any physician to enter upon a subject on some
points of which it is probable that a portion of the profession is at variance
with him, either from disbelief in the alleged increase of criminal
abortion, unnoticed for reasons shown hereafter, or from a blind reliance
on Providence of itself to abate the evil.</p>

<p>2. His fear, lest by any possible chance, by showing the frequency of
the crime and its means, he may unhappily cause its still further increase.</p>

<p>3. The reluctance on the part of many of the profession to attack a
powerful and acknowledged moneyed interest;</p>

<p>4. And to tell their patients, more commonly than is yet general, most
unwelcome truth; thus not merely condemning, but, to their own consciences
at least, criminating them;</p>

<p>5. And individually to risk losing practice, if thought more scrupulous
than others;</p>

<p>6. And to be brought into more frequent contact with the law, even
though for ends of justice;</p>

<p>7. And to exercise greater care and discretion in diagnosis and treatment,
lest themselves be brought to answer for malpractice, or worse;</p>

<p>8. And publicly to discuss matters supposed to be generally unknown,
and thus seem to throw open professional secrets to the world.</p>

<p>And, finally, grave doubts lest the statements made, though simple and
true, should yet appear so astounding as to shock belief, or so degrading
as to tend to lessen all faith in natural affection and general morality.</p>

<p>But these objections, so far at least as regards the profession, are undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
but of limited existence; and, on the other hand, as more than
counterbalancing them all, are the following arguments:—</p>

<p>That medical men are the physical guardians of women and their offspring;
from their position and peculiar knowledge necessitated in all obstetric
matters to regulate public sentiment and to govern the tribunals of
justice.</p>

<p>That the discussion by them of this crime may very probably be the
means, in great measure, of ultimately restraining or suppressing its perpetration.</p>

<p>That such will undoubtedly tend to save much health to the community
and many human lives.</p>

<p>And, that, were there no other reason, it is clearly a duty.</p>

<p>I shall accordingly proceed to prove, so far as possible, the truth of
every premise as yet stated, and to show the real nature and frequency of
the crime: its causes; its victims; its perpetrators and its innocent abettors;
its means and its proofs; its excuses, the deficiencies and errors of
existing laws, and the various other obstacles to conviction; and, above
all, so far as the present series of papers is concerned, the duty of the
profession toward its general suppression.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I_IS_ABORTION_EVER_A_CRIME">I. IS ABORTION EVER A CRIME?</h2>

</div>

<p>That this could have been doubted, least of all by mothers, however
ignorant or degraded, would at first sight appear improbable. The sense
of the public, however, its practice, its laws, being each proved to the
contrary by the stubborn evidence of facts, the necessity of our preliminary
inquiry will be made manifest.</p>

<p>To postpone, for the present, all other considerations, we will regard
abortion in the abstract. It may be defined, best perhaps, as the violent
and premature expulsion of the product of conception, independently of
its age, viability, and normal formation. These characteristics are eliminated
as having judicially and actually nothing to do with the essential
nature of abortion, whereas in infanticide they are each elements of great
importance; a difference that will hereafter be seen.</p>

<p>We further, in the present investigation, set aside all cases where abortion
is the result of accident, or from natural causes, or justified by the
rules of medicine, whether to save the mother or her child. We shall have
occasion, in the subsequent course of our inquiries, to discuss this latter
question somewhat fully, and to set forth unpleasant truths. We now
confine ourselves exclusively to those instances where the attempt at premature
expulsion of the product of conception is artificially induced and
intentional, and where, so far as can be judged, it is not necessitated and
would not otherwise have occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, the laws do not recognize that unnecessary abortion,
<i>per se</i>, is a crime.</p>

<p>This act, when unnecessarily done, must be for one of two reasons:
either to prevent the product of conception from receiving life, which
subsequent evidence will show cannot be the case, or, if living, to destroy
it.</p>

<p>We have said that the Common Law and many of our American statutes
lose sight of this fundamental idea. Though based upon the first of
the above alternatives,—the erroneous one, as regards the fact of their existence,—they
are so worded as almost wholly to ignore fœtal life, to refuse
it protection, to insure their own evasion, and by their inherent contradictions
to extend the very crime they were framed to prevent.</p>

<p>They recognize, for the most part, no offence against the fœtus; we
have just shown that such, and such alone, is always intended. They
punish an attempt, which does not exist, upon the well-being or life of
the mother; the intent being seldom or never to destroy the mother. She
is herself, in almost every case, a party to the action performed; an accessory
or the principal. To constitute a crime, a malicious or wicked
intent is supposed to exist; we have thrown aside, as does the law, every
case occurring from accident or from justifiable cause. The intent, if
existing, as of course must be always the case, is against, and only against,
the product of conception.</p>

<p>Again, the punishment meted by the law proves the truth of these propositions.
Unless the woman die in consequence of the offence, it is declared,
in every stage of pregnancy, a mere misdemeanor, as in Massachusetts;
or else, while called such, or by omission justified or openly allowed
in the early months when the fœtus is without other safeguard,
the law pronounces abortion a felony and increases its penalties in more
advanced pregnancy, after quickening has rendered it infinitely more certain
that the fœtus will remain undisturbed, and has thus in the great majority
of cases prevented the crime.</p>

<p>On the other hand, granting for the moment that the erroneous assumptions
of the law were correct, and that the attempt were upon the life of
the mother, how inconsistent to punish murder, attempted or committed,
if by injury to the throat or heart, capitally, and if by injury to the womb,
by temporary imprisonment; especially where this latter case always necessitates
the slaughter of a second human victim.</p>

<p>Or, granting that the attempt were only upon the mother’s health or
temporary welfare, how absurd to punish the offence in early pregnancy,
where her risks are greatest, by a trifling penalty or not at all, and in more
advanced pregnancy, where these risks are daily lessened, with increased
severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>And, finally, if the fœtus were, as has been sometimes supposed, merely
<i>pars viscerum matris</i>, its removal would be like that of a limb, or of any
other portion of the body, whose loss is not absolutely attended with that
of life; if made with the mother’s consent, it would be unpunishable by
law; if against her will, it would be already amenable, like other maim
or mutilation, to existing statutes. In the one case, laws against abortion
were needless; in the other, unjustifiable.</p>

<p>In a word, then, in the sight of the common law, and, in most cases
of the statutory law, also, the crime of abortion, properly considered, does
not exist; the law discussing and punishing a wholly supposititious offence,
which not only does not exist, but the very idea of whose existence is
simply absurd.</p>

<p>We turn now to public opinion. It, too, both in theory and in practice,
fails to recognize the crime. Its practical denial of the true character
of the offence will be shown in the course of our remarks on its
frequency. Its theoretical denial we here consider, as proved in three
ways—by implication, by collateral testimony, and by direct.</p>

<p>First, the maxims of the law are based on past or present public
opinion. If merely on past, and this has totally changed, the law in
matters of such importance is compelled to change also. The fact that
the laws on this subject remain unaltered, if it be granted, as will be
proved, that they are erroneous, furnishes us at the outset, and so far,
with evidence that public opinion was formerly wrong, and that it so continues.</p>

<p>The frequency of the offence, and the character and standing of the
mothers upon whose persons it is practised, accessories as we have seen,
or principals, to it, furnish similar and more cogent testimony regarding
the theory upon which it is founded. We shall soon perceive how extensive
and high reaching is the frequency; we must therefore conclude that
the public do not know, or knowing deny, the criminal character of the action
performed.</p>

<p>Again, the direct testimony of the parties themselves is often available.
It is undoubtedly a common experience, as has certainly been that of the
writer, for a physician to be assured by his patients, often no doubt
falsely, but frequently with sincerity, that their abortions have been induced
in utter ignorance of the commission of wrong; in belief that the
contents of the womb, so long as manifesting no perceptible sign of life,
were but lifeless and inert matter; in other words, that being, previously
to quickening, a mere ovarian excretion, they might be thrown off and expelled
from the system as coolly and as guiltlessly as those from the bladder
and rectum.</p>

<p>It having now been shown, directly and by temporary assumption, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the law and public sentiment, both by its theory and its practice, alike
deny to unjustifiable abortion the imputation of crime, it remains for us to
discuss this question abstractly, and to prove not merely that they are
wrong, but that the offence is one of the deepest guilt, a crime <span class="smcap">second to
none</span>.</p>

<p>Ignorance of the law is held no excuse. The plea of ignorance of
guilt could hardly better avail where its existence is implied by common
sense, by analogy, and by all natural instinct, binding even on brutes.
Were this guilt, however, clearly shown, and its knowledge, supposed
wanting, to be spread broadcast by the press, the all-powerful arbiter of
public opinion, the last and strongest prop of the crime were gone.</p>

<p>It has been shown, by setting aside all accidental cases, those naturally
occurring and those necessarily, and in the absence of reasonable evidence
to the contrary, that all other abortions must be intentional, that they
must be occasioned by the “malice aforethought” of the law. It has also
been shown that in these cases, except it exist as an additional element,
the malicious intention is not against the life or person of the mother, but
that in every instance it is against the product of her womb. Hence,
the whole question of the criminality of the offence turns on this one fact,
the real nature of the fœtus in utero. If the fœtus be a lifeless excretion,
however soon it might have received life, the offence is comparatively as
<i>nothing</i>; if the fœtus be already, and from the very outset, a human being,
alive, however early its stage of development, and existing independently
of its mother, though drawing its sustenance from her, the offence becomes,
in every stage of pregnancy, <span class="smcap">murder</span>.</p>

<p>“Every act of procuring abortion,” rules Judge King, of Philadelphia,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
contrary to the usual interpretation of the law, “is murder, whether the
person perpetrating such act intended to kill the woman, or merely feloniously
to destroy the fruit of her womb.”</p>

<p>Common sense, we have said, would lead us to the conclusion that the
fœtus is from the very outset a living and distinct being. It is alike
absurd to suppose identity of bodies and independence of life, or independence
of bodies and identity of life; the mother and the child within
her, in abstract existence, must be entirely identical from conception to
birth, or entirely distinct. Allowing, then, as must be done, that the
ovum does not originate in the uterus; that for a time, however slight,
during its passage through the Fallopian tube, its connection with the
mother is wholly broken; that its subsequent history is one merely of
development, its attachment merely for nutrition and shelter, it is not
rational to suppose that its total independence, thus once established, becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
again merged into total identity, however temporary; or that life,
depending not on nine months’ growth, nor on birth, because confessedly existing
long before the latter period,—since quickening at least, a time varying
within wide limits,—dates from any other epoch than conception; while
it is as irrational to think that the influence of the father, mental and moral
as well as physical, so often and so plainly manifested, can be exercised by
any possibility upon the child at any other moment than that original and
only one of impregnation itself.</p>

<p>Another argument is furnished us, similar, but differing. The fœtus,
previous to quickening, as after it, must exist in one of two states,
either death or life. The former cannot take place, nor can it ever exist,
except as a finality. If its signs do not at once manifest themselves, as is
generally the case, and the fœtus be retained in utero, it must either become
mummified or disintegrated; it can never again become vivified. If,
therefore, death has not taken place, and we can conceive no other state
of the fœtus save one, that, namely life, must exist from the beginning.</p>

<p>These reasonings are strengthened by the evidence of analogy. The
utter loss of direct influence by the female bird upon its offspring from the
time the egg has left her, and the marked effect, originally, of the male;
the independence in body, in movement, and in life, of young marsupial
mammals, almost from the very moment of their conception, identical
analogically with the intra-uterine state of other embryos,—nourishment by
teat merely replacing that by placenta at an earlier period; the same in
birds, shown by movements in their egg on cold immersion before the end
of incubation; the permanence of low vitality, or of impaired or distorted
nervous force, arising from early arrest or error of development, and necessarily
contemporaneous with it, are all instances in point.</p>

<p>Brute instincts are often thought wholly supplanted by human reason.
That this is not so is proved by what obtains in the absence of reason,
whether from the outset or subsequently occurring. Idiots and lunatics
alike show the actual identity in this respect of man and the brute, however
instinct, in the former, may normally be tempered by conscience and
reason. Whatever ideas on the subject of abortion the human mind may
have forced itself to entertain, let the slightest proof concerning the existence
of fœtal life be alleged, and maternal instinct at once makes itself
known: the parent, as after its birth, would often even perish to preserve
her child. This is not conscience, which is stirred only by an afterthought,
but instinct.</p>

<p>Thus far, incidental proof concerning the commencement of fœtal life,
and so the guilt of unjustifiable abortion. More decisive evidence is at
hand.</p>

<p>That the movements of the fœtus, subsequent to quickening, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the actual nature of that first sensation may be, declare the existence of
intra-uterine life, is allowed by the world; by none more than by mothers
themselves, whose statistics prove that after the perception of these movements
criminal abortions are comparatively rare.</p>

<p>But quickening,—a period usually occurring from the one hundred and
fifteenth to the one hundred and thirtieth day after conception, but varying
within still more appreciable limits in different women, and in the same
women in different pregnancies, from variations in the amount of liquor
amnii, the early strength of the fœtus, and other causes, and also, if at all,
owing in its first sensation to rising of the womb from the pelvis, probably
occurring a little earlier with boys than with girls, from their relative
difference in size,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—is often absent, even throughout pregnancy; and fœtal
movements are sometimes appreciable to the attendant when not to the
mother, or indeed to the mother alone.</p>

<p>Further, in premature births, where quickening has not occurred, or before
its usual period, by the movements of the fœtus, its earlier independent
and vital existence is sometimes reduced to a matter of ocular demonstration;
while to the ear, in very many instances, as early and as conclusive
evidence is afforded by the sounds these movements give rise to.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Quickening is therefore as unlikely a period for the commencement of
fœtal life as those others set by Hippocrates and his successors, varying
from the third day after conception, to that of the Stoics, namely birth, and
as false as them all.</p>

<p>We need not, with Dubois<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and some earlier writers,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> from the manifest
relation of means to the end, consider that the movements of the fœtus in
utero, and its consequent attitude and position, are signs of an already developed
and decided sentience and will, nor is it requisite to suppose
them the effect of an almost rational instinct. But that they are wholly
independent of the will and the consciousness of the mother, and yet by no
means characteristic of organic life, whether hers or its own,—which latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
is also by abundant evidence proved independently to exist,—but decidedly
animal in their character; that they are not explainable by gravity, despite
all the arguments alleged, latest by Matthews Duncan,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> nor on
any other supposition save that of a special and independent excito-motory
system, distinct from that of the mother,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> brings us directly down to
this—the existence of as distinct and independent a nervous centre, self-existing,
self-acting, living.</p>

<p>We set aside all the speculations of metaphysicians regarding moral accountability
of the fœtus, the “potential man,” and its “inanimate vitalities,”
as useless as they are bewildering. If there be life, then also the existence,
however undeveloped, of an intellectual, moral, and spiritual nature,
the inalienable attribute of humanity, is implied.</p>

<p>If we have proved the existence of fœtal life before quickening has taken
place or can take place, and by all analogy and a close and conclusive
process of induction, its commencement at the very beginning, at conception
itself, we are compelled to believe unjustifiable abortion always a crime.</p>

<p>And now words fail. Of the mother, by consent or by her own hand,
imbrued with her infant’s blood; of the equally guilty father, who counsels
or allows the crime; of the wretches who by their wholesale murders far
out-Herod Burke and Hare; of the public sentiment which palliates, pardons,
and would even praise this so common violation of all law, human
and divine, of all instinct, of all reason, all pity, all mercy, all love, we
leave those to speak who can.</p>

<p>We have next to prove—</p>

<p>Though we cannot at once, and in exact figures, show the yearly
amount of criminal abortion in this country, statistics on the subject being
necessarily imperfect or wanting, we may yet arrive at an approximate
result. This is done by an easy and reliable process of induction, the
several factors of which, each of itself rendering probable the conclusion,
tend, when combined, to make it almost absolutely certain.</p>

<p>Several of these points are as yet almost wholly uninvestigated. They
are stated, therefore, with care, as bearing decidedly on the question at
issue, and as tending to provoke still further research.</p>

<p>To go into an elaborate comparison of our national and state censuses
with themselves, past and present, with each other, and with those of
similar communities abroad, involving, as it would do, intricate calculations
regarding the effect of emigration from state to state, and from nation
to nation, the increase of urban population, and the frequent decrease
of rural, is not our present intention, nor is it necessary. By considering
this point in connection with that immediately succeeding it, with
which it is intimately related, its bearing and importance will at once be
seen.</p>

<p>Statistics in this country are as yet so imperfect, that we are necessitated
to a process of deduction. If it can be shown that a state of things
prevails elsewhere to a certain extent, explainable only on one supposition,
and that the same state of things prevails in this country to a greater extent,
all other causes, save the one referred to, being in great measure absent,
little doubt can be entertained of the part this plays; but if it can,
in addition, be proved that this cause must necessarily be stronger with
us than elsewhere, then its existence becomes morally certain. Accordingly,
if we find that in another country living births are steadily lessening
in proportion alike to the population and to its increase, that natural or
preventive causes are insufficient to account for this, while the proportion
of still-births and of known abortions is constantly increasing, and these
last bear an evident yet increasing ratio to the still-births; that in this
country the decrease of living births, and the increase of still-births, are in
much greater ratio to the population, and the proportion of premature
births is also increasing; that these relations are constant and yearly
more marked, we are justified in supposing that abortions are at least as
frequent with us, and probably more so.</p>

<p>In many countries of Europe, it has been ascertained that the “fecundity”
of the population, or the rate of its annual increase, is rapidly diminishing.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>In Sweden, it has lessened by one-ninth in 61 years. In Prussia, by a
third in 132 years. In Denmark, by a quarter in 82 years. In England,
by two-sevenths in a century. In Russia, by an eighth in 28 years.
In Spain, by a sixth in 30 years. In Germany, by a thirteenth in 17
years. In France, by a third in 71 years.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Or, in other words:</p>

<p>In Sweden it has lessened by a fifth; in Prussia, by a fourth; in Denmark
and England, by a third; and in Russia, Spain, Germany, and
France by a half, in a single century.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, larger bodies of statistics existing concerning
it, and from the fact that it represents the extreme of the alleged
decrease, we take France for our comparisons.</p>

<p>In France at large, according to the official returns as analyzed by Legoyt,
the increase of the population which, from 1801 to 1806, was at the
rate of 1.28 per cent. annually, from 1806 to 1846 had fallen to about .5
per cent.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The exact ratio of decrease after this point is better shown
by the figures themselves. The increase from 1841 to 1846 was 1,200,000;
from 1846 to 1851, 380,000; from 1851 to 1856, 256,000.</p>

<p>In England, during this latter period, with a population of but one-half
the size, the returns of the Registrar-General show a relative increase
nine times greater.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In thirty-seven years, from 1817 to 1854, the mean
annual increase in France was not more than 155,929, yet in five years,
from 1846 to 1851, it had fallen to 76,000 yearly, and from 1851 to 1856,
to 51,200, and this with a population ranging from twenty-nine to thirty-four
millions.</p>

<p>A comparison of these facts, with those obtaining in other European
States, will make the above still more evident. We now quote from Rau.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

that the proportionate number of births must be decreasing in

<p>In Paris, strange to say, the decrease in the ratio of births to the population,
though decided and steady, has not, in actual proportion, been as
great as in the empire at large, showing that the cause, whatever we find
it to be, is not one depending on the influence of a metropolis alone for its
existence.</p>

<p>From 1817 to 1831 there averaged, in Paris, one birth to 26.87 inhabitants;

<p>Again, as might have been expected, we find that the proportion of
still-births, in which we must include abortions, as has hitherto been done,
however improperly, in all extensive statistics, is enormous, and is steadily
increasing. To show this the more plainly, we first present a table of the
ratio of still-births to the living births in the various countries of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The apparent discrepancy between city and country, noticed as equally
obtaining in Belgium and France, is chiefly owing to greater negligence
of the country officials in registering the still-births, and to the fact, as
we have seen in Paris, that the ratio of births to the population is greater
in the city than in the country at large.</p>

<p>Finally, while the proportion of still-births to the whole number is greatly
increasing in Paris, so is the number of known abortions.</p>

<p>We omit, for the present, the evidence afforded by arrests and trials,
which we might here have turned to account. At the Morgue, which represents
but a very small fraction of the fœtal mortality of Paris, and in
this matter almost only crime, there were deposited during the eighteen
years preceding 1855, a total of 1115 fœtuses,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of which 423 were at the
full term, and 692 were less than nine months; and of these last, 519, or
five-sixths, were not over six months, a large proportion of them showing
decided marks of criminal abortion.</p>

<p>Again, of the 692 fœtuses of less than nine months, deposited at the
Morgue during these eighteen years, 295 were between 1836 to 1845, an
average, at that time, of 32.7 yearly; and from 1846 to 1855 there were 397,
an average of 44.1. During the means of these periods the births in France
were as follows<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>:—In 1841, 1,005,203, and in 1851, 1,037,040, from which
it is evident that there was deposited at the Morgue, in 1841, one infant,
dead from abortion, to every 30,700 births; and in 1851, one to every
23,500. The increased ratio is seen to be striking; it will hereafter become
apparent that the increase is far greater in reality.</p>

<p>We turn now to our own country, to which the City of New York holds
much the same relation, as respects public opinion no less than in other
matters, that Paris holds to France.</p>

<p>Since 1805, when returns were first made to the Registry of New York,
the number, proportionate as well as actual, of fœtal deaths, has steadily
and rapidly increased. With a population at that time (1805) of 76,770,
the number of still and premature births was 47; in 1849, with a population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
estimated at 450,000, the number had swelled to 1320.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Thus, while
the population had increased only <i>six</i> times since 1805, the annual number
of still and premature births had multiplied over <i>twenty-seven</i> times.</p>

<p>The following table shows the rapidity of this increase:—The ratio of
fœtal deaths to the population, was in</p>

<p>In the three years preceding 1849, there were registered in New York
400 premature births, and 3139 children still-born; a total of 3539, representing
at that time a yearly average of some 1200 fœtal deaths. While
it will be shown hereafter that a large proportion of the reported premature
births must always be from criminal causes, and that though almost
all the still-births at the full time, even from infanticide, are necessarily registered,
but a small proportion of the abortions and miscarriages occurring
are ever reported to the proper authorities, it will immediately be made
apparent that at the present moment the abortion statistics of New York
are far above those of 1849.</p>

<p>In the three years preceding 1857, there were registered in New York
1196 premature, and 4735 still-births,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> a total of 5931, representing a
yearly average of some 2000 fœtal deaths; showing that in the short
space of seven years, the number of fœtal deaths in New York, already
enormous, had very nearly doubled.</p>

<p>Again, in 1856, the total number of births at the full time in New York,
was 17,755; of these, 16,199 were living;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> proving that of children at the
full time alone, setting aside the great number of viable children born prematurely,
and the innumerable earlier abortions not recorded, one in every
11.4 is born dead.</p>

<p>From foreign statistics on a large scale, it is found that the proportion
of still-births, even allowing a wide margin for criminal causes, does not,
in those countries, drop below 1 in 15, and this in France, ranging from
that number up to 1 in 30 or 40 of the whole number of births reported.
We have already given a table upon this point.</p>

<p>In Geneva, out of 10,925 births occurring from 1824 to 1833, 1221 of
them being <i>illegitimate</i>, and therefore to be supposed liable to a large percentage
of deaths from criminal causes, there were only 646 fœtal deaths;
a proportion of 1 in 17.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>In Belgium there were 29,574 <i>illegitimate</i> births from 1841 to 1843,
and of these, 1766 were born still;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> 1 in 16.8.</p>

<p>In New York, from 1854 to 1857, there were 48,323 births, and 5931
still-births, at the full time and prematurely; or in other words, 1 to every
8.1 was born dead.</p>

<p>The ratio of still-births in New York, including, as we have seen, abortions,
is steadily increasing, as seen by the following table,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in which we
have compared the still-births, supposable perhaps of accidental value,
with the general mortality, whose value is at least as accidental, if not
more so. The evidence, like that already furnished, is astounding.</p>

<p>The frequency of abortions and premature births reported from the
practice of physicians, and thus to a certain extent, but not entirely, likely
to be of natural or accidental origin, is as follows:—</p>

<p>In 41,699 cases registered by Collins, Beatty, La Chapelle, Churchill,
and others,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> there were 530 abortions and miscarriages. Here all the
abortions were known; their proportion was 1 in 78.5.</p>

<p>In New York, from 1854 to 1857, there were 48,323 births at the full
time reported, and 1196 premature. Here all the abortions were not
known, probably but a very small fraction of them; the proportion was
1 in 40.4.</p>

<p>Finally, we compare the recorded premature still-births of New York,
with those still at the full time.</p>

<p>In the seventeen years from 1838 to 1855,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> there were reported 17,237
still-births at the full time, and 2710 still prematurely; the last bearing the
proportion of 1 to 6.3.</p>

<p>In the nine years, from 1838 to 1847, omitting 1842 for reasons stated
below, there were 632 premature still-births, and 6445 still at the full
time; a yearly average of 1 in 10.2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>In the eight years, from 1848 to 1855, there were 2078 premature still-births,
and 10,792 still at the full time; an average of 1 in 5.</p>

<p>While in 1856 there were 387 still prematurely, and 1556 at the full
time; or 1 in 4.02.</p>

<p>From these figures there can be drawn but one conclusion, that criminal
abortion prevails to an enormous extent in New York, and that it is
steadily and rapidly increasing. “We cannot refer,” was well said by a
former inspector of that city,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> “such a hecatomb of human offspring to
natural causes.” We shall now endeavor to prove this point by other
reasoning.</p>

<p>That our deductions concerning the population and births of France
are perfectly legitimate, is admitted beforehand by the leading political
economists of the day; ignorant as they were in its various relations of
much of the evidence now brought forward, and of the conclusion to which
the whole matter, directly and with almost mathematical exactness, is
proved to tend.</p>

<p>“In France,” remarks De Jonnés,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> “the fecundity of the people is restrained
within the strictest limits.”</p>

<p>“The rate of increase of the French population,” says Mill, “is the
slowest in Europe;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> the number of births not increasing at all, while the
proportion of births to the population is considerably diminishing.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>We have seen, moreover, that in France the actual ratio of living births
is constantly and rapidly diminishing, while the still-births, actual and
proportional, are as fast increasing; that the premature births progress
in similar ratio, and by deduction and actual statistics, the criminal abortions;
and that these facts obtain not merely in the metropolis, but
throughout the country.</p>

<p>What are the causes of these remarkable facts, need it now be asked?
Let all allowances be made for certain conjugal habits extensively existing
among the French, and by no means rarely imitated in this country, but
the proportionate decrease of living births is too enormous, the actual and
proportionate increase of premature and still-births is too frightful to be
wholly explained thus, or as West,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Husson,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and De Jonnés<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> have
thought, to be attributed to a mere progressive lack of fecundity.
Reason and the evidence alleged compel us to believe that in great measure
they are owing to criminal abortion.</p>

<p>Political economists allow the facts in France to be as we have stated.
Their interpretation of the causes, unwilling as they would be to confess
its ultimate bearing, we now compel to serve as evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“They depend,” according to one writer,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> “either on physical agents,
especially climate, or on the degree of civilization of a people, their domestic
and social habits.” “In France the climate is favorable to an increase
of population, and this obstacle, this restraint, is found in its advanced
civilization.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>“This diminution of births,” says Legoyt,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> “in the presence of a constant
increase of the general population and of marriages, can be attributed
to nothing else than wise and increased foresight on the part of the parent.”</p>

<p>“The French peasant is no simple countryman, no downright ‘Paysan
du Danube;’ both in fact and in fiction he is now ‘le rusé paysan.’ That
is the stage which he has reached in the progressive development which
<i>the constitution of things has imposed on human intelligence and human
emancipation</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>“These facts are only to be accounted for in two ways. Either the
whole number of births which nature admits of, and which happen in some
circumstances, do not take place, or if they do, a large proportion of those
who are born, die. The retardation of increase results either from mortality
or prudence; from Mr. Malthus’s positive, or from his preventive
check; and one or the other of these must and does exist, and very powerfully
too, in all old societies. Wherever population is not kept down by
the prudence of individuals or of the State, it is kept down by starvation
or disease.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>But on the other hand, it has been forgotten that the alternative supposed
does not exist in the case we have instanced. Marriages in France,
unlike some other continental States, are continually increasing, and starvation
and disease are yearly being shorn of their power. The authors
quoted are therefore forced to a single position; that the lessening of
births can only be owing to “prudence” on the part of the community.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is allowed by Mill and by Malthus himself,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that so
much of the decrease as cannot thus be explained, must be attributed to
influences generally prevalent in Europe in earlier ages, and in Asia to the
present time. “Throughout Europe these causes have much diminished,
but they have nowhere ceased to exist.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Several of them have been
named by the authority now quoted. Another, and greater than them all,
he leaves unspoken; we are compelled to supply for him the omission.</p>

<p>The practice of destroying the fœtus in utero, to say nothing of infanticide,
history declares to have obtained among all the earlier nations of the
world, the Jews alone excepted, and to a very great extent. Aristotle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>

Africa and Polynesia,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> to such an extent, that we may well doubt whether
more have ever perished in those countries by plague, by famine, and the
sword.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that the actual and proportionate increase of
still-births, and, by induction, setting aside all probable cases of infanticide,
of abortion, and the comparative increase of a population reciprocally
influence and govern each other so completely, that from the one it
may in any given case be almost foreseen what the other must prove.</p>

<p>It is impossible that the results quoted from the Registry of New York,
any more than those of France, even if so far, can in any great measure
be owing to natural causes alone. They are wholly inexplicable on any
principles, “which do not recognize an amount of guilt at which humanity
shudders.” In comparing that city with Paris, certain allowances must indeed
be made; abroad, for the effects of wars and conscription, of despotism,
and of migration outward; at home, for the effects of governmental laxity,
and of migration inward. In both cities the amount of prostitution, an
element not to be lost sight of, must be nearly the same; and in both,
under the steady progress of science, medical and hygienic, the ratio of
fœtal mortality, unless induced by criminal causes, may year by year be
supposed to have been steadily diminished.</p>

<p>We have seen that in New York, in the absence of all influences that
tend to keep down population in foreign countries, old and crowded, and
under the yoke of despotism, the effects, attributable elsewhere to these
causes, exist, and to a greater degree than in any other country;</p>

<p>That the ratio of fœtal deaths to the population had swelled from 1 in
1633, in 1805, to 1 in 340, in 1849; while in France, at a later period,
1851, they were only about 1 in 1000;</p>

<p>That the actual number of fœtal deaths in seven years, from 1850 to
1857, had very nearly doubled;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>That the fœtal deaths, as compared with the total of births, elsewhere
in cases of illegitimacy, where the results are the very worst, and where
crime is confessed to have produced them, being 1 in 16.8,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> had here,
legitimate and natural, reached the frightful ratio of 1 in 8.1;</p>

<p>That the fœtal deaths, as compared with the total mortality, had increased
from 1 in 37, in 1805, to 1 in 13, in 1855;</p>

<p>That the reported early abortions, of which the greater number of course
escape registry, bear the ratio to the living births of 1 in 40.4, while elsewhere
they are only 1 in 78.5;</p>

<p>And finally, that early abortions, bearing the proportion to the still-births
at the full time of 1 in 10.2, in 1846, had increased to 1 in 4.02, in
1856.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that these statistics are positive, proving
the existence of a certain number of pregnancies abruptly terminated.
They cannot therefore be controverted by any argument regarding means
for the prevention of pregnancy, no matter to what extent these may be
used. Nor should it be forgotten that for every registered premature
birth or abortion, innumerable ones occur that are never recorded.</p>

<p>Almost doubling therefore, as does New York, the worst of those fearful
ratios of fœtal mortality existing in Europe, it is not strange that our
metropolis has been held up, even by a Parisian, to the execration of the
world. “On le voit (l’avortement)” says Tardieu, “en Amérique, dans
une grande cìté comme New York, constituer une industrie véritable et
non poursuivie.”</p>

<p>In this description of New York, we have that of the country.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The
relative annual increase of the population existing throughout America,
depending as this does chiefly on immigration, must not mislead us. The
ratio of fœtal death in the metropolis surpasses what has ever been dreamed
to obtain even in old countries, where innumerable more legitimate causes
for it might be thought to exist. At Boston, which for morals is allowed
to compare favorably with any city of its size in the Union, “undoubtedly
more than a hundred still-births yearly escape being recorded, a large proportion
of which, no doubt, result from criminal abortion.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> And our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
public prints, far and wide, even in the smaller towns and villages, constantly
chronicle deaths from the commission of the crime.</p>

<p>In the State of Massachusetts at large, it has been found of late years
that “the increase of the population, or the excess of the births over the
deaths, has been <i>wholly</i> of those of <i>recent foreign origin</i>;”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> this in 1850.
In 1853 “it is evident that the births within the Commonwealth, with the
usual increase, have resulted in favor of foreign parents in an increased
ratio.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In other words, it is found that in so far as depends upon the
American and native element, and in the absence of the existing immigration
from abroad, the population of Massachusetts is stationary or decreasing.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>“This result will doubtless surprise many, who will hardly think it possible.
Is it general, or is it accidental? If it be general, how has it
happened? What causes have been in operation to produce it? How
is it to be accounted for?”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> These questions have hitherto been unanswered.
We shall find, however, their solution only too easy.</p>

<p>Amid such general thrift and wealth, there has been every reason for
the native, like the foreign population, to increase. The preventive check
of the economists, though undoubtedly present, can have played but an
inferior part, as we shall prove. Emigration westward, the only apparent
positive check, though extensive, cannot wholly account for the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>But statistics exist by whose light, if acknowledged, we may read this
important problem.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In 1850, the ratio of births to the population in Massachusetts, foreign
and American combined, was 1 in 36,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and in 1855, 1 in 34;<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> a ratio
much smaller than that obtaining in most countries of Europe, and about
equaling that of France, which, in 1850, was 1 in 37.</p>

<p>In 1855, the ratio of still-births, at the full time and premature, as compared
with the living births, was 1 to 15.5.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In France it is 1 to 24; in
Austria, 1 to 49.</p>

<p>In 1851, the ratio of fœtal deaths to the general mortality, was 1 to
13.3;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> in 1855,1 to 10.4.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> In New York City, in 1856, it was 1 to 11.
In any city we should expect to find the proportion much greater than in
a State at large; we here find it less.</p>

<p>The ratio of premature births to those at the full time, during the period
from 1850 to 1856, was 1 to 26.1.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In New York, in 1857, it was
1 to 40, and in good medical practice it is found, as we have seen, to be
1 in 78.</p>

<p>In comparing the recorded abortions and premature births in the City
of New York, with the still-births there occurring at the full time, we
found that the former had varied from 1 in 10, in 1838, to 1 in 4, in 1856.</p>

<p>In the State of Massachusetts it appears, that during the fourteen years
and eight months preceding 1855, there were recorded 4570 still-births,
and 11,716 premature births and abortions,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the ratio being 1 abortion
to .3 still-birth; or, in other words, it would appear from the statistics
quoted, that the comparative frequency of abortions in Massachusetts is
<i>thirteen</i> times as great as in the worst statistics of the City of New York.
We are willing, however, we rejoice, to modify this statement, as in the
earliest of the years quoted, returns from the City of Boston seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
been imperfect or wanting,—and to confine our calculations to a more recent
period.</p>

<p>From 1850 to 1855, the registration being much more accurate than
before, and its results compiled with the greatest care, three years of the
five by a noted statistician, Dr. Shurtleff, there were recorded in Massachusetts,
2976 still-births, and 5899 premature births and abortions,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> the
ratio being 1 abortion to .5 still-birth; in other words, the frequency of
abortions as compared with still-births at the full time, seems at least eight
times as great in Massachusetts as in the worst statistics of the City of
New York.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that while nearly every still-birth at the full
time is necessarily recorded, there must be but very few registrations of
the premature births and abortions actually occurring; that though the
contrary seems here the case, such occurrences are generally, as they would
be supposed, far more frequent in crowded cities than in country districts,
or in a State at large; and that however great may be the influence of
the prevention of pregnancy in repressing a population, these constitute
proofs of pregnancies actually occurring, and frequently criminally terminated.</p>

<p>Few persons could have believed possible the existence of such frightful
statistics, the result toward which they must be confessed inevitably to
tend, or the dread cause from which they spring. Either these statistics
must be thrown aside as utterly erroneous and worthless, or they must be
accepted with their conclusions. We would gladly do the former, but
they present too many constant quantities, in other respects,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> for this to be
allowed. Our own calculations have been made with care, and we have
presented the elements on which they rest. In asserting the results, at
once so awful and astounding, we desire to fix upon them the attention
and scrutiny of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>We have seen that the increase of the population of Massachusetts by
living births, is almost exclusively among its resident foreigners, Catholics,
the rules of whose church will hereafter be shown to exercise an important
influence in preventing the destruction of fœtal life. The conclusion
cannot therefore well be avoided, that in these facts there exists the
evident relation here intimated, of effects to cause.</p>

<p>With some certainty, then, even though statistics are as yet so imperfect,
can we assert this conclusion, that frightful as is the extent to which
the crime of abortion is perpetrated abroad, there is reason to believe that
it prevails to an equal, if not even greater extent at home.</p>

<p>The frequency of arrests or trials for abortion afford, save indirectly, no
criterion of the actual frequency of the crime. Our laws on this subject
are at present so easily evaded, that officers of justice find it useless to
trouble themselves with its prosecution; it is indeed “non poursuivie.”
During the eight years from 1849 to 1858, no report for 1853 being rendered
by the Attorney-General, there were 32 trials for abortion in Massachusetts;
and in these there was not a single conviction.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> An estimate
that for every arrest for this crime, a thousand instances of its
commission escape the vigilance or at least the hand of the law, would
probably be within the truth. That such is the fact, is shown by the statistics
of France, where, from 1846 to 1850, out of 188 cases that came to
the knowledge of the police, for lack of decisive evidence, only 22 went to
trial,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> or about one-ninth of those legally investigated. From 1826 to
1853, there were in France 183 trials for abortion. At the above ratio
this will give about 1700 cases judicially examined, a yearly average
throughout the empire of between 50 and 60. Comparing this fact with
the statistics of the Morgue already given, and with those of the actual
decrease of the rate of increase of the population in Paris and in New
York, and the increase of premature births, our statement of its frequency
will not seem exaggerated.</p>

<p>The number and success of professed abortionists is notorious. If arrested,
they are always ready with bribes or abundant bail. Hardly a
newspaper throughout the land that does not contain their open and
pointed advertisements, or a drug-store whose shelves are not crowded
with their nostrums, publicly and unblushingly displayed: the supply of
an article presupposes its demand. From these facts we may fairly estimate
the extent of their nefarious traffic.</p>

<p>That families are seldom now found of the size formerly common, is also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
a matter of general remark. It were foolish to attempt to explain this
by supposing that the present is an age of more moderate desire, or less
unbridled lust; there is too much collateral proof against any such plea.
Nor is it reasonable to think that women are generally becoming less productive
of offspring than formerly, from any natural cause; or that the
mass of our population, whatever the exceptions, are already so far advanced
in knowledge, physiological or mechanical, or in practice, as in
most cases to be able to regulate impregnation at will. The number of
pregnancies must be nearly as abundant as ever; who can doubt what becomes
of the offspring? We deny, simply and decidedly, the statement
of some writers, that of every seven pregnancies, at least one always <i>naturally</i>
terminates in abortion; this is uncorroborated by any reliable
evidence, and is without doubt untrue.</p>

<p>Of the experience of physicians, there can be but one opinion. If each
man of the profession were honestly to investigate this matter, and as
honestly to avow the result, the mass of evidence would be overwhelming.
This statement is in nowise invalidated by the experience alleged by
many, especially among older practitioners; their evidence, based chiefly
on lack of inquisition, or on the acknowledged less prevalence of the crime
in former years, is merely negative, and as such only to be valued.</p>

<p>“We blush,” says Prof. Hodge, “while we acknowledge the fact, that
in this city, (Philadelphia,) where literature, science, morality, and Christianity
are supposed to have so much influence; where all the domestic
and social virtues are reported as being in full and delightful exercise,
even here” it prevails.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Blatchford, of Troy, N. Y., writes me thus: “A crime which forty
years ago, when I was a young practitioner, was of rare and secret occurrence,
has become frequent and bold.” But why multiply instances of what
must be the almost universal experience?</p>

<p>Applications for abortion are in many neighborhoods of constant occurrence,
by no means among the poorer classes alone; and few women,
unless also convinced by their physician of the enormity and guilt of that
they intend, are deterred by his refusal from going elsewhere for aid, or
from inducing abortion upon themselves.</p>

<p>But far greater proof than this we all possess, or can, if we desire. In
but few of the abortions criminally induced is an application ever made to
the physician in regular standing. He is oftener called upon after the
crime has already been committed, to treat its acute and immediate effects.
If he choose to take for granted in every case, that it has occurred from
a perfectly natural cause, even where attending circumstances clearly point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
to the contrary, or to ask no questions, or to shut his eyes and his ears to
evident and patent facts, he can of course do so, and perhaps persuade
himself that the crime is rare; but if he reflect that upon himself more
than on clergyman or legislator, often rests the standard of public morals,
and act accordingly, he may arrive at a different result.</p>

<p>But this is not only the fact in acute cases of abortion. The same
statement holds true, perhaps even to a greater extent, with regard to
chronic obstetric disease. It is now acknowledged that much of this is
really the consequence of past difficult or abnormal labors; that the more
complicated or improperly interfered with the labor has been, the more
certain are unfortunate sequelæ; and that the earlier in pregnancy its occurrence,
the greater, as a general rule, the danger, not merely to the mother’s
life, but to her subsequent health. In the treatment of these results,
even more marked perhaps at a late period than earlier, the dependence
of effect on cause, and their evident connection, can often be learned by a
faithful inquirer, and in no small proportion of cases does the history go
back without turn or the shadow of a doubt, to an induction of criminal
abortion.</p>

<p>As a mere matter of individual experience, and from a practice by no
means exceptional, the writer some time since reported no less than fifteen
such cases as occurring to himself within hardly six months; and of these,
all without exception were married and respectable women,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> many of
them of wealth and high social standing; and subsequently he was able,
in consultation, to point out similar cases in the practice of gentlemen
who, at that time, had denied the legitimacy of his conclusions. This experience
must be a common one, only some lack the courage, as others
lack the will, to investigate the matter; should they do so, they can come
but to one result.</p>

<p>The frequency of maternal deaths, confessedly from criminal abortion,
as gathered from published statements and mortuary reports, is also an
item of importance in our summary of evidence. It is probable that in
but few of the fatal cases really occurring, is foul play ever thought of,
especially if the standing of the victim, and her previous history, have
been such as to prevent or disarm suspicion; and on the other hand,
while immediate death is undoubtedly a frequent result of induced abortion,
it is, in proportion to the cases of its later occurrence, or of confirmed
and chronic ill health, comparatively rare. From which it must
be granted, that for every case thus made known, very many others must
necessarily exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>We are compelled, from the preceding considerations, to acknowledge
not merely that criminal abortion is of alarming frequency among us, but
that its frequency is rapidly increasing; this having been made apparent
by each link in the chain of evidence that has been presented. Every
effort that might possibly check this flood of guilt will, if delayed, have so
much the more to accomplish. The crime is fast becoming, if it has not
already become, an established custom, less honored in the breach than in
the observance.</p>

<p class="tb">That public opinion should at present attach so little importance to the
value of fœtal life, has already been shown to be owing in great measure
to ignorance respecting its actual existence in the earlier months of pregnancy.
Two other, and no less general, physiological errors prevail, extensively
inculcated by popular authors and lecturers for their own sinister
purposes.</p>

<p>One of these is the doctrine that it is detrimental to a woman’s health
to bear children beyond a certain number, or oftener than at certain
stated periods, and that any number of abortions are not merely excusable,
as preventives, but advisable; it being entirely forgotten that the frequency
of connection may be kept within bounds, and the times of its occurrence
regulated, by those who are not willing to hazard its consequences; that
if women will, to escape trouble or for fashion’s sake, forego the duty and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
privilege of nursing, a law entailed upon them by nature, and seldom neglected
without disastrous results to their own constitutions, they must
expect more frequent impregnation; that the habit of aborting is generally
attended with the habit of more readily conceiving; and that abortions,
accidental, and still more if induced, are generally attended by the loss
of subsequent health, if not of life.</p>

<p>This error is one which would justify abortion as necessary for the mother’s
own good; a selfish plea. The other is based on a more generous
motive. It is that the fewer one’s children, the more healthy they are
likely to be, and the more worth to society. It is, however, equally fallacious
with the first, and is without foundation in fact. The Spartans and
Romans, so confidently appealed to, gave birth probably to as many weakly
children as do our own women; that they destroyed many for this reason
in infancy, is notorious. The brawny Highlanders are not the only offspring
of their parents; the others cannot endure the national processes
of hardening by exposure and diet, and so die young from natural
causes. But were this theory true even so far as it goes, the world, our
own country, could ill spare its frailer children, who oftenest, perhaps, represent
its intellect and its genius.</p>

<p>In asserting that the doctrines of the leading political economists for
the last half century are accountable for much of the prevalence and increase
of the crime, ignorant or careless as these writers all seem of the
dire means that would be resorted to for the attainment of their ends, I
have in no way exaggerated. Malthus remarks in his well-known Essay
on Population, that “in the average state of a well-peopled territory, there
cannot well be a worse sign than a large proportion of births, nor can
there well be a better sign than a small proportion;”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and he endorses
the assertion of Hume, subsequently proved false by Sadler,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that the
permission of child-murder, by removing the fear of too numerous a family
in case of marriage, tends to encourage this step, and thereby the increase
of population; “the powerful yearnings of nature preventing parents
from resorting to so cruel an expedient, except in extreme cases.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and a host of others might also be quoted, but a few extracts
from a later writer, standard in this country at present, and taught in our
universities, till very lately in that at Cambridge, for instance, will suffice.</p>

<p>“We greatly deprecate,” says Mill, “an increase of population, as rapid
as the increase of production and accumulation.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“There is room in the world, no doubt, and even in old countries, for
an immense increase of population. But although it may be innocuous,
I confess I see very little reason for desiring it.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content
to be stationary long before necessity compels them to it.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>“If the opinion were once generally established among the laboring
class, that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of their
families, only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the
habit of making light of social obligations generally.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> “The principles
contended for include not only the laboring classes, but all persons, except
the few who being able to give their offspring the means of independent
support during the whole of life, do not leave them to swell the competition
for employment.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>“When persons are once married, the idea never seems to enter any
one’s mind, that having or not having a family, or the number of which it
shall consist, is at all amenable to their own control. One would imagine
that it was really, as the common phrases have it, God’s will and not their
own, which decided the number of their offspring.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>“In a place where there is no room left for new establishments,” says
Sismondi, entirely ignoring the escapes offered by emigration and the increased
importation of food, “if a man has eight children, he should believe
that unless six of them die in infancy, these, and three of his own
contemporaries of each sex, will be compelled to abstain from marriage
in consequence of his own imprudence.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The direct result of remarks like these last, so pointed and plainly to
be understood, is seen in the statistics I have so largely given. Would
mankind, in following such advice, merely resort to greater abstinence before
their means allow the expense of children, and to greater prudence
after that period, no fault could be found; but when we discover criminal
abortion thus justified and almost legitimated, we may well oppose to such
doctrine the words of the indeed admirable Percival, “To extinguish the
first spark of life is a crime of the same nature, both against our Maker
and society, as to destroy an infant, a child, or a man.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Fear of child-bed, in patients pregnant for the first time, or who had
suffered or risked much in previous labors, might formerly have been allowed
some weight in excuse, but none at all in these days of anæsthesia.
It has been urged, and not so absurdly as would at first sight appear, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the present possibilities of painless and so much safer delivery, by changing
thus completely the primal curse, from anguish to a state frequently
of positive pleasure, remove a drawback of actual advantage, and by offering
too many inducements for pregnancy, tend to keep women in that
state the greater part of their menstrual lives.</p>

<p class="tb">The consideration in detail of the various other causes to which I have
alluded as accounting for the prevalence of abortion, together with that of
the many special reasons offered in individual cases by way of excuse, I
postpone for the present; merely premising that where ignorance is so
evidently and so extensively its foundation, those who, possessing, yet
withhold the knowledge which by any chance or in any way would tend to
prevent it, themselves become, directly, and in a moral sense, responsibly
accountable for the crime.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III_ITS_VICTIMS">III. ITS VICTIMS.</h2>

</div>

<p>We have hitherto discussed abortion in the abstract, as a crime, and in
its relations to the community at large. We have seen its heinous nature,
and its awful extent.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The division of the subject now to be examined naturally presents itself
under a fourfold aspect, numerical, relational, social, and medical; representing
respectively the multitude of the victims of abortion, their character
as parent and child, their standing in the community, and the
degree, whether unto death or otherwise, of their suffering.</p>

<p>So far as statistics will at present allow, the numerical relations of the
victims of abortion have already been fully discussed, the yearly thousands
of fœtal and the frequent maternal deaths; one sacrifice at least, that of
the child, being implied in every case.</p>

<p>Various incidental questions suggest themselves in this connection,
curious, and by some, though erroneously, thought to be of judicial importance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Two of them will be here adverted to; they are the age or
the mother and that of the fœtus.</p>

<p>It was formerly supposed, as in infanticide, that criminal abortion was
seldom resorted to save for the concealment of shame; and as seductions,
confessedly frequent in comparison with adultery, are most common in
youth, it was laid down as probable that wilful abortions are most frequent
between the years corresponding, from sixteen to twenty-five. Subsequent
experience, however, has disproved this conclusion, and it is
evident that the only real limit to its later occurrence is the menstrual
climacteric. In many instances of marriage, abortions are resorted to at
once, in others after the family has reached a certain point, and are thence
regularly continued.</p>

<p>The age of the fœtus is of much more interest; not, as will ultimately
appear, for the same reason as in cases of infanticide, but as proving to
a certain extent one of the facts we have already considered, the error
prevalent regarding the commencement of fœtal life.</p>

<p>It was Orfila’s opinion that criminal abortion was most frequent in the
two first months of pregnancy. This would naturally have been supposed
the case, as then some doubt might always obtain regarding its existence,
and the excuse that the measures resorted to were for the purpose of preventing
ill effect from an abnormal menstrual suppression would be more
available. Devergie, on the other hand, was inclined to put the limits of
greatest frequency at from three months to four and a half; while Briand
and Chaudé thought the crime more common in the third month than the
fifth, and in this last month much more frequent than even in the first or
second. Tardieu also came to a similar conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> He ascertained,
that of 34 cases investigated by himself, 25 were in from the third to the
sixth month, most in the third; 5 in the first two months; 4 in the
seventh and eighth; or that the cases in the third month, or shortly after,
were five times as numerous as at either an earlier or a later period, and
nearly three times as numerous as in both combined.</p>

<p>Upon examining the Register of the Morgue, we find its statistics
strikingly corroborative of these deductions. We have already seen that
from 1837-54 there had been deposited at the Morgue 692 fœtuses of less
than nine months. Of these,</p>

</table>

<p>It has been stated that 519, or five-sixths of them all, were not over
six months, and it now appears that on a scale twenty times larger than
that given by Tardieu from his own experience, nearly two-thirds of the
fœtal deaths induced by abortion were in from the third to the sixth month
of pregnancy; the three periods included giving a much larger proportion
than any others, and the two last of them being almost identical. The
extreme paucity shown by the above table in the first and ninth months,
and the decrease in the seventh and eighth from those preceding, are
worthy of remark. It is probable that the sudden increase may be attributed
to mental reaction after the first shock occasioned by the absolute
certainty of pregnancy is past; and the subsequent decrease to the fact
that in many attempted criminal abortions during the later months children
are born alive, the mother’s courage then proving insufficient for
infanticide and its greater and more probable punishment.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that while frequently the crime is committed in
the very earliest period of pregnancy, in the belief that possibly all alarm
may be false, in most cases the woman waits a month or two to be sure
that she really is pregnant. After the sixth month the comparative rarity
of the crime is undoubtedly owing to the fact that fœtal life is then
rendered certain by the perceived movements of the child, the more
strongly as pregnancy advances.</p>

<p>It was formerly thought that the induction of criminal abortion was
confined to the unmarried alone; there exists, however, abundant proof
to the contrary. Had such been the fact it would be reasonable to suppose
that with the increase of marriages, the number of premature and
still-births would have lessened. In proportion, however, as the number
of marriages has increased, so has the number of fœtal deaths, and in
similar ratio the number of living births has declined; proving, as Husson
was compelled to acknowledge of Paris, “a decrease in the fecundity
of legitimate unions,”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> explainable in nowise but by a criminal cause.
Direct statistics on this point are still wanting, and must come, almost
entirely, from medical men. The writer’s published experience has been
already referred to; subsequent practice has only confirmed it.</p>

<p>Again, the victims of abortion are not confined to the inhabitants of
cities. Of the prosecutions in France during 1851-53, it appears that
but little more than a tenth of the whole number occurred in the Department<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of Seine.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But we have already furnished much stronger evidence
on this point.</p>

<p>Finally, though the excessive extravagance of the day, entailing as it does
to so many an annual expenditure incommensurate with their income, is accountable
in no small degree for the crime, yet it cannot always be alleged.
There is too much reason to believe that with our communities it is as
with others. In France it appears that the poor and uneducated have on
the whole the largest families, contrary in some respects to established
hygienic rules; while, on the other hand, the rich are inclined as far as
possible to restrict the number of their children, often indeed stipulating
beforehand, at marriage or previously, that such shall be few or none.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>But not only must we believe that this crime prevails in our midst to
an almost incredible extent among the wealthy and educated and married;
we are compelled to admit that Christianity itself, or at least Protestantism,
has failed to check the increase of criminal abortion. It is not astonishing
to find that the crime was known in ancient times, as shown by
evidence previously given, nor that it exists at the present day among
savage tribes, excused by ignorance and superstition; but that Christian
communities should especially be found to tolerate and to practice it, does
almost exceed belief.</p>

<p>In the previous remarks, the French have been compared with our own
people, not merely because of their published statistics, but because from
their loose morals and habits of life they might be thought to represent
the extreme to which the crime would be likely to obtain among civilized
nations. We have shown reason to suppose that we equal them in guilt,
if we do not exceed them. Now it must be borne in mind that the French
are Catholic; that the rules of that church do not, as has been generally
supposed, permit abortion in the earlier months,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> but that they rigidly
exercise over fœtal life throughout pregnancy the most absolute guard and
supervision;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> instances of this in cases where craniotomy is supposed to be
indicated, are familiar to every practitioner. The church, here omnipotent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
against the physician, and desiring that every created human being
should receive the benefit of baptism, demands that fœtal death must
have taken place previously to the operation proposed. It does not seek
for the signs of fœtal life, but takes this for granted, and requires that its
absence must be proved before allowing the removal of the child, even
though this is necessary to save the mother’s life.</p>

<p>The rule runs thus: “Sedulam operam dent sacerdotes, ut quantum
poterunt, impediant nefandum illud scelus quo adhibitis chirurgicis instrumentis
infans in utero interficitur. Omnis fœtus quocumque tempore
gestationis editus baptizetur, vel absolute, si constet de vitâ; vel sub conditione,
nisi evidenter pateat eum vitâ carere.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>In cases where instrumental delivery is absolutely necessary, the ceremony
of baptism as ordinarily administered is of course impossible. But as this
is deemed so important by the Catholic Church,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> even to the sacrifice of
the mother, any means of overcoming this obstacle, fatal to countless
maternal lives, should be accounted, if found practicable, of the utmost
importance. For this purpose, therefore, I do not hesitate to recommend
intra-uterine baptism, the consecrated element being carried to the child,
if too high to be reached by the hand, by a sponge and staff, or if necessary,
by a syringe, as was long ago sanctioned by the theologists of the
Sorbonne;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> in the absence of a clergyman, if the case is urgent, the rite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
accounted so sacred being performed by the physician in attendance rather
than to allow the death of the mother. I know that many of the profession,
from fear of ridicule or dislike to sanction what they do not believe in,
would shrink from such a duty. Is it not, however, due to humanity in
every way to prevent this frequent murder? for such, by our apathy and
neglect, the mother’s death in these cases becomes. Can we, as Christians,
refuse <i>any</i> aid? I am not ashamed to acknowledge that for myself,
though no Catholic, I have performed this intra-uterine baptism, where delivery
without mutilation was impossible. I could neither conscientiously
assert the child’s death, nor allow the mother to linger till it should occur,
while the friends, in the absence of a priest, whose presence it was impossible
to procure for many hours, would not permit the operation. Remonstrance
was useless; had I refused I should have been morally responsible
for the almost inevitable death of the woman; it was, therefore,
simply my duty.</p>

<p>I shall now quote from an admirable letter I have lately received from
the Catholic Bishop of Boston. The extracts are couched in so forcible
language, and their spirit is so thoroughly Christian, that I need not
apologize for their length, or that they recapitulate arguments I have
already advanced.</p>

<p>“The doctrine of the Catholic Church,” remarks Bishop Fitzpatrick,
“her canons, her pontifical constitutions, her theologians without exception,
teach, and constantly have taught, that the destruction of the human
fœtus in the womb of the mother, <i>at any period from the first instant
of conception</i>, is a heinous crime, equal, at least, in guilt to that of murder.
We find it distinctly condemned as such even as far back as the
time of Tertullian, (at the end of the second century,) who calls it <i>festinatio
homicidii</i>, a hastening of murder. The Pope, Sixtus the Fifth, in
a bull published in 1588, subjects those guilty of the crime to all the
penalties, civil and ecclesiastical, inflicted on murderers. It is denounced
and reprobated in many other canons of the church.</p>

<p>“The reason of this doctrine (apart from the authority of the church)
must, it seems to me, appear evident upon a little reflection. The very
instant conception has taken place, there lies the vital germ of a man.
True, it is hidden in the darkness of the womb, and it is helpless; but it
has sacred rights, founded in God’s law, so much the more to be respected
because it is helpless. It may be already a living man, for neither mothers
nor physicians can tell when life is infused; they can only tell when
its presence is manifested, and there is a wide difference between these
two things. At any rate, it is from the first moment potentially and <i>in
radice</i> a man, with a body and a soul destined most surely by the will of
the Creator and by his law, to be developed into the fullness of human existence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
No one can prevent that development without resisting and annulling
one of the most sacred and important laws established by the
Divine Author of the universe, and he is a criminal, a murderer, who
deals an exterminating blow to that incipient man, and drives back into
nothingness a being to whom God designed to give a living body and an
immortal soul.</p>

<p>“From this it follows that the young woman whose virtue has proved
an insufficient guardian to her honor, when she seeks by abortion to save
in the eyes of man that honor she has forfeited, incurs the additional and
deeper guilt of murder in the eyes of God, the judge of the living and the
dead. Who can express what follows with regard to those women, who,
finding themselves lawfully mothers, prefer to devastate with poison or
with steel their wombs, rather than bear the discomforts attached to the
privilege of maternity, rather than forego the gaieties of a winter’s balls,
parties, and plays, or the pleasures of a summer’s trips and amusements?</p>

<p>“But abortion,” the Bishop continues, “besides being a direct crime
against a positive law of God, is also an indirect crime against society.
Admit its practice, and you throw open a way for the most unbridled
licentiousness, you make woman a mere instrument for beastly lust.
Every woman is somebody’s mother or daughter or sister or wife; or she
bears all these relations at once. Whatever protection, therefore, we
would claim for a woman because she stands in any of these relations to
us, we should also extend to all women, because they bear some one of
all these relations to others. Most assuredly, then, we should remove
none of the safeguards that protect female virtue. But if we take away
the responsibility of maternity, we destroy one of its strongest bulwarks.</p>

<p>“It affords me pleasure,” he concludes, “to learn that the American
Medical Association has turned its attention to the prevention of criminal
abortion, a sin so directly opposed to the first laws of nature, and to the
designs of God, our Creator, that it cannot fail to draw down a curse upon
the land where it is generally practiced.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Such being the doctrine of the Catholic Church, and statistics nevertheless
proving that its so stringent statutes against the destruction of
fœtal life, enforced alike by denouncement and excommunication, are constantly
broken in Catholic France, it is more than probable, from the existence
of this fact, in addition to all the various causes of the crime we
have seen equally prevailing there and in this country, that the actual
number of abortions is much greater with ourselves; at least with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
American and native portion of our population. We have indeed shown
that this is really the case in Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Viewing this subject in a medical light, we find that death, however
frequent, is by no means the most common or the worst result of the attempts
at criminal abortion. This statement applies not to the mother
alone, but, in a degree, to the child.</p>

<p>We shall perceive that many of the measures resorted to are by no
means certain of success, often indeed decidedly inefficacious in causing
the immediate expulsion of the fœtus from the womb; though almost
always producing more or less severe local or general injury to the
mother, and often, directly or by sympathy, to the child.</p>

<p>The membranes or placenta may be but partially detached, and the
ovum may be retained. This does not necessarily occasion degeneration,
as into a mole or hydatids, or entire arrest of development. The latter
may be partial, as under many forms, from some cause or another, does
constantly occur; if from an unsuccessful attempt at abortion, would this
be confessed, or indeed always suggest itself to the mother’s own mind?
Fractures of the fœtal limbs prior to birth are often reported, unattributable
in any way to the funis, which may amputate indeed, but seldom
break a limb. A fall, or a blow, is recollected; perhaps it was accidental,
perhaps not, for resort to these for criminal purposes is very common. In
precisely the same manner may injury be occasioned to the nervous system
of the fœtus, as in a hydrocephalic case long under the writer’s own
observation, where the cause and effect were plainly evident. Intra-uterine
convulsions have been reported; as induced by external violence they are
probably not uncommon, and the disease thus begun may eventuate in
epilepsy, paralysis, or idiocy.</p>

<p>To the mother there may happen correspondingly frequent and serious
results. Not alone death, immediate or subsequent, may occur, from metritis,
hemorrhage, peritonitic or phlebitic inflammation, from almost
every cause possibly attending not merely labor at the full period, comparatively
safe, but miscarriage,—increased and multiplied by ignorance,
by wounds and violence; but if life still remain, it is too often rendered
worse than death.</p>

<p>The results of abortion from natural causes, as obstetric disease, separate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
or in common, of mother, fœtus or membranes, or from a morbid
habit consequent on its repetition, are much worse than those following
the average of labors at the full period. If the abortion be from accident,
from external violence, mental shock, great constitutional disturbance
from disease or poison, or even necessarily induced by the skilful
physician in early pregnancy, the risks are worse. But if, taking into
account the patient’s constitution, her previous health and the period of
gestation, the abortion has been criminal, these risks are infinitely increased.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Those who escape them are few.</p>

<p>In thirty-four cases of criminal abortion reported by Tardieu, where
the history was known, twenty-two were followed, as a consequence,
by death, and only twelve were not. In fifteen cases necessarily induced
by physicians, not one was fatal.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose, with Devergie, that death must be immediate,
and owing only to the causes just mentioned. The rapidity of death, even
where directly the consequence, greatly varies; though generally taking
place almost at once if there be hemorrhage, it may be delayed even for
hours where there has been great laceration of the uterus, its surrounding
tissues, and even of the intestines;<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> if metro-peritonitis ensue, the patient
may survive for from one to four days, even indeed to seven and ten.
But there are other fatal cases, where on autopsy there is revealed no appreciable
lesion; death, the penalty of unwarrantably interfering with
nature, being occasioned by syncope, by excess of pain, or by moral shock
from the thought of the crime.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>That abortions, even when criminally induced, may sometimes be safely
borne by the system, is of little avail to disprove the evidence of numberless
cases to the contrary. We have instanced death. Pelvic cellulitis, on
the other hand; fistulæ, vesical, uterine, or between the organs alluded
to; adhesions of the os or vagina, rendering liable subsequent rupture of
the womb, during labor or from retained menses, or, in the latter case,
discharge of the secretion through a Fallopian tube and consequent peritonitis;
diseases and degenerations, inflammatory or malignant, of both
uterus and ovary; of this long and fearful list, each, too frequently incurable,
may be the direct and evident consequence, to one patient or
another, of an intentional and unjustifiable abortion.</p>

<p>We have seen that in some instances the thought of the crime, coming
upon the mind at a time when the physical system is weak and prostrated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
is sufficient to occasion death. The same tremendous idea, so laden with
the consciousness of guilt against God, humanity, and even mere natural
instinct, is undoubtedly able, where not affecting life, to produce insanity.
This it may do either by its first and sudden occurrence to the mind; or,
subsequently, by those long and unavailing regrets, that remorse, if conscience
exist, is sure to bring. Were we wrong in considering death the
preferable alternative?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV_ITS_PROOFS">IV. ITS PROOFS.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is by no means an easy thing in all cases to obtain evidence that an
abortion has occurred; still more difficult, that it has been intentionally
induced. As most laws read, it is necessary at the outset to prove the
existence of pregnancy; as many still stand, it must be shown that the
woman has quickened. These requisitions are unwise and unjust, and
under them, if insisted on by adroit counsel, it is almost useless to pursue
prosecution. In the earlier months, before quickening has occurred or
the fœtal pulsations have become evident to the ear, it is impossible,
as I have elsewhere insisted,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> ever to be sure of the existence of pregnancy,
and yet attempts at its termination are then in no degree less
criminal. The only infallible sign of pregnancy is the sound of the fœtal
heart, not always to be detected, even by the double stethoscope.</p>

<p>Putting aside, therefore, the question of the existence of pregnancy
and of fœtal life, as taken for granted on the one hand by the attempt
at their termination, and as proved on the other by this result, it is found
that the evidence of abortion classifies itself into proofs of its occurrence,
of its commission, of the criminal intent, and of the identity of the party
accused.</p>

<h3>1. <i>The Occurrence.</i></h3>

<p>The abortion may perhaps be known to have taken place by confession
or witness; in either case requiring no further demonstration. Instances
are not rare, however, where suspicion merely may exist, and the fact
must be proved by collateral testimony; and this in two cases, where the
woman is still alive, and where she is dead.</p>

<p>The general history of the case, even if pregnancy and delivery be
equally denied, may throw some light on its true nature. This as given,
no matter how affected by the evidence of interested or implicated witnesses,
may be probable or improbable; as in an instance related by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Burns,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> where her sudden lessening in bulk was ascribed by a patient to a
night’s profuse sweating, of course an impossible result. But, on the
other hand, care is necessary lest from its rarity of occurrence or its improbability,
the reality should be disbelieved. Cases are on record where
innocent women, suffering from retention of menses or from ovarian disease,
and suddenly relieved by a critical and spontaneous discharge, have
on suspicion of abortion lost character and even their lives. If the statements
contradict each other, this fact of itself may reveal the truth.</p>

<p>There are at times difficulties in proving delivery at the full period of
pregnancy, as is well known. The earlier in gestation, if the patient survive,
the more these difficulties are enhanced. The occurrence of normal
labor cannot be discovered with any certainty by a personal examination
after eight days have elapsed,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> those of an early abortion not even after
only one or two.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The signs of delivery that are well marked at the full
period, the general symptoms then obtaining, the size of the uterus, ascertained
by the hand and sound, lacerations of the perineum and cervix, the
lochia, the state of the breasts, abdomen, vagina, and vulva, all of little
value except in conjunction with each other, are proportionately less defined
as we go back, until near the commencement of pregnancy it becomes
impossible to distinguish the abortion from severe hemorrhage or
from menorrhagia, unless by detecting the impregnated ovum.</p>

<p>If the patient is dead, and too long time have not elapsed since the
supposed occurrence, decision is often more easy; many facts in the case
being generally known, and concealment being less possible. If the ovum,
but partially detached, be still retained, the fact is self-evident; if it has
been discharged, and concealed or lost, there will still be present the recent
corpus luteum and other well-known signs, in proportion to the period of
the pregnancy. Allowance, in this latter respect, must be made for the
possibility of partial uterine contraction after death, as is sometimes
known to occur at the full period;<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the writer has seen it to a marked
degree some time previous to the expiration of pregnancy, at a Cæsarean
section after death from laryngitis, occurring in the Edinburgh Maternity
Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<h3>2. <i>The Commission.</i></h3>

<p>Allowing the fact of the occurrence of an abortion to be proved or
granted, it becomes necessary to discover its cause, whether accidental,
natural, or intentional. Of this it will be found that the proofs are both
positive and negative; drawn from the history of the case and from personal
examination of the patient and the fœtus. The value of each of
these elements is increased in proportion as it is compared with the
other; but “this I wish most especially to have noted, that <span class="smcap">wherever
there is a miscarriage, there is always present some actual, perceptible,
and often tangible cause</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The story of the patient may be to one effect, and that of other parties
involved, to a very different one; if the first is corroborated by the second,
it may again, as has already been remarked, present or not the likelihood
of truth. If the habit of aborting at a certain period has existed, which
of course cannot be alleged in a first pregnancy, if the patient has had
sudden fright or grief, or is known to have been accidentally injured, the
chances are to be considered in her favor, in the absence of proof to the
contrary. The converse of this statement, however, must not be considered
as always and necessarily true. Women have time and again
suffered shipwreck, undergone torture, been thrown from a height, and
otherwise severely injured, and yet have escaped miscarriage; while, on
the other hand, they may repeatedly have aborted before, and yet passing
safely their usually critical point, may without trouble go on to the full
period. In still other cases there may exist local disease, pelvic or uterine,
which, if left alone, would of itself occasion miscarriage.</p>

<p>The character of the abortion is not without its value, whether occurring
suddenly and without apparent cause, or preceded by maternal disease or
the signs of fœtal death.</p>

<p>Examination of the mother, though proof that she has herself been injured
is not necessary to establish the crime, may reveal local wounds and
mutilations; or their absence, which, however, by no means goes to
prove that violence may not have been inflicted; and, on the other hand,
as in a case lately reported by the writer to the Boston Society for Medical
Observation, traces of former violence in instrumental or other
labors may remain, and to such an extent as to give to the touch every
character of a recent and criminal interference.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The fœtus may show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
pre-existing and natural disease sufficient to account for the effect apparent,
or may present the signs of direct and intentional interference.
Recent scars of venesection on the arms and feet, and of leech-bites,
especially on the upper and inner parts of the thighs, are suspicious in a
patient who has aborted, unless they were evidently required by the state
of her previous health. If signs of irritant injections into the vagina
are present, they are ground for more than suspicion.</p>

<p>The instrument, where used, with which the operation has been performed,
may sometimes be identified; though this is almost impossible
unless by confession or direct testimony. The weapons resorted to by the
unprofessional are various; knitting kneedles, pen handles, skewers, goose
quills, pieces of whale-bone, and even curtain rods, are among the number.
The finger alone, except where the uterus is prolapsed or can be depressed,
and the os is very soft and patulous, is seldom if ever sufficient for the
deed. If a physician be accused, it is important to notice with what instrument
the crime is said to have been performed, if before witnesses, and
whether it was introduced openly or under pretence of a digital examination.</p>

<p>The sensations of the patient at the time, are also in different cases
unlike each other. In some instances nothing unusual is observed, in
others a prick or probing, but in most an acute and tearing uterine pain,
often followed by syncope or an hysterical attack. Slight but immediate
hemorrhage generally occurs, save in professional cases, increased by compelled
exercise, prolonged baths or ergot.</p>

<p>The time ensuing before the expulsion of the fœtus is an element not
to be lost sight of. In 34 cases reported by Orfila, the minimum observed
was 13½ hours, the maximum 6 days; in 36 cases by Tardieu, the
minimum was 5 hours, the maximum 11 days. Of these last cases, however,
29 were within 4 days.</p>

<p>It cannot be alleged in excuse that the sex of the child, so fatal in advanced
pregnancy, has any influence in producing early abortion. In 293
premature still-births reported by Collins,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> 146 were male and 147 female,
bearing the proportion of 100 to 100. Nor can the plea of Drs. Gordon
Smith, Good, Paris, and Copeland, that as a fœtus born before the
seventh month has a slender chance of surviving, its murder should be
viewed with leniency,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> be allowed. Such arguments, that the perils and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
dangers to which the fœtus is naturally subjected should lessen the criminality
of attempts at its destruction, are without foundation, and when
advanced by physicians are utterly unworthy the profession.</p>

<h3>3. <i>The Intent.</i></h3>

<p>We shall hereafter discuss the perpetrators of the crime, and the emergencies
which can alone justify the induction of premature labor or obstetric
abortion. We shall see that by none save medical men can such necessity
ever be known; it is, therefore, apparent that the intent may frequently
be judged from the relation of the parties implicated, and the excuses
offered by them. It will also often appear from the other circumstances
of the case. That the child was likely to be born a bastard, and to be
chargeable to the reputed father, would be evidence to that effect; and
proof of the clandestine manner in which the drugs were procured or
administered would tend the same way.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>On the part of the mother, bastardy also, the having denied the existence
of pregnancy, concealed its expelled product, expressed an intention
or desire to abort, made a known application for this purpose, visited a
notorious abortionist, taken alleged specifics, or given similar advice to a
friend, are all presumptive evidence; as are also the having neglected to
send for aid when needed, or refused to take precautions or remedies
when prescribed. In like manner, evidence of criminal intent would seem
apparent, if drugs generally supposed abortive had been advised or given
to a pregnant woman, or violence of any kind usually productive of the
effect in question, even to tooth-drawing, had been hastily or unnecessarily
used.</p>

<p>Here, as in many other cases where no malice is expressed or openly
indicated, the law will imply it; if, for instance, a man wilfully poisons
another, in such a deliberate act the law presumes malice, though no particular
enmity can be proved.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Malice is not confined in its legal definition
to ill-will toward one or more individual persons, but is intended to
denote an action flowing from any wicked or corrupt motive, a thing done
<i>malo animo</i>, where the fact has been attended with such circumstances as
carry in them the plain indications of a heart regardless of social duty
and fatally bent on mischief; and, therefore, it is implied from any deliberate
or cruel act against another.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The rule is, that the implication
of malice arises in every such case, and all the circumstances of accident,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
necessity, or infirmity are to be satisfactorily established by the party
charged, unless they arise out of the evidence and attending circumstances;
if they do not, there is nothing to rebut the natural presumption
of malice. This rule is founded on the plain and obvious principle that
a person must be presumed to intend to do that which he voluntarily and
wilfully does in fact do, and that he must intend all the natural, probable,
and usual consequences of his own act.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The standing in society of the accused, unless notoriously bad, should
of course be allowed to weigh but little; the less the likelihood of the
crime, the greater, from example and previous education, its guilt.</p>

<p>If violent purging or vomiting have been resorted to without any apparent
reason, or to a greater extent than ordinarily prescribed or required;
or if leeches have been applied to the thighs, to the number of an
hundred or more, as instanced by Tardieu, or the like, there is certainly
ground for strong suspicion. And here it is that the criminal liability of
careless or ignorant physicians becomes evident. In cases such as we
have referred to, it would be very difficult for a successful defence to be
offered, providing the pregnancy had been suspected by those not implicated,
were the statutes on abortion properly drawn and enforced.</p>

<p>It has been ruled, and very justly, that attempts at the crime, though
unsuccessful; or effective, yet the ovum retained as mole, hydatids, skeleton,
mummy, or putrilage; and whether the woman be pregnant or not,
and if pregnant, whether the child be alive, dead, or, abnormally developed
or degenerated, should be amenable as though fully consummated.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
We have seen the frequent difficulty in proving fœtal life; the
attempt at its destruction shows the belief in its existence, and the intent.
The proofs will here of course be of a different nature. The signs of
delivery will be absent, and all evidence from the product of conception,
unless the mother’s death ensue; in which event, as in the other fatal cases
we have considered, and on the principle just laid down, procedure might be
had on the charge either of abortion or homicide; but it must not be forgotten,
as we early pointed out, that immediate death from the shock may
occur, and no lesion of any kind be found. The patient or parties interested
are proved by the attempt to have supposed pregnancy existing,
and to have behaved as though this were the fact.</p>

<p>The age of the patient is not of consequence; nor is that of the fœtus,
save as corresponding with the alleged period of pregnancy, in case any
doubt exist as to its own identity or that of the mother, and as bearing on
the statement we have already attempted to prove, that criminal abortion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
is comparatively rare after the period of quickening, and, therefore, on
the probability of intent. The number of the pregnancy is also wholly
immaterial, different as are the causes alleged for its criminal induction,
and equally liable in youth and age, as women seem to be, to accident or
placental disease. Whitehead and West are of opinion that abortion naturally
resulting is most common after the sixth pregnancy,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> but the point
needs further investigation.</p>

<p>Among the proofs of intent must be included, as we have seen, the excuses
offered by the accused or suspected party, and the means resorted
to for consummation. These we now proceed to examine.</p>

<p>It will be evident that the plea of necessity can be made by none but
a medical man. We shall show that the cases where abortion is legitimated
by the rules of science are extremely few, and that for safety’s sake
their applicability should in no instance be allowed to rest upon a single
opinion.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> For all others beside the physician there can be no allowable
excuse except, in the mother’s case, insanity; which, however common in
the true puerperal state, and often no doubt then showing itself by infanticide,
has in early pregnancy, and to any extent, still to be observed.
Other pleas as offered by the mother, ignorance of pregnancy or of fœtal
life, duress, personal health or that of her family, accident, carelessness, fear
of child-bed, malpractice on part of the attendant, we have already considered
at sufficient length. It is sometimes effected in hatred of the
husband or in jealousy, sometimes for concealment of shame; excuses of
little more value than those of extravagance or fashion. Constitutional
predisposition can hardly be asserted, unless the miscarriage have been
preceded by others; very many ineffectual attempts are on record, although
the existence of such predisposition was evident. It will often be alleged
that the measures instituted were to prevent instead of to effect the miscarriage,
and that this has resulted in consequence merely of an excess
of good-will; the sophistry is generally apparent.</p>

<p>The means resorted to are for two purposes: on the one hand, to prepare
the patient for the abortion and preliminarily to lessen her danger,
or to conceal the character of those, on the other hand, which really occasion
it, and for this end used prior or subsequently to them. We may
yet take occasion to consider these several agents in some detail; it remains
only to remark that their use in any given case must be compared
with what was then actually needed, or would have been required had the
abortion been justifiable and necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>Certain drugs, ergot and savin for instance, the class of so-called abortives,
popularly considered specific, are always suggestive of evil intent.
They would not be used, were abortion necessary, by a well-informed
practitioner, caring for the life of the parent or fœtus. The same is
true, though of course to a more limited extent, of all over-drugging,
over-manipulation, or over-exertion by a pregnant woman, by whomsoever
advised or performed. In every instance it is necessary to compare
the cause alleged with the effects observed, and to judge of it from these.
Where direct operative manœuvres are suspected or charged, the processes
or instruments, the results, immediate and consecutive as well as
remote, the period elapsing before their occurrence, must all be taken into
careful consideration.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, it is immaterial what was the agent, and
whether or not it would produce abortion, if it was believed capable of
this effect, and employed or administered with that intent. If the person
charged knew that the woman was with child, and the probable effect of
the agent administered, this is good presumptive evidence that the intent
was to produce the miscarriage, and where the effect of abortion is actually
thus produced, it will materially aid the presumption of such
intent.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>It was stated early in this inquiry that a difference existed between the
methods of investigation, as regards the examination of the fœtus, proper
in abortion and infanticide. The reason of this has been pointed out
by Tardieu.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In the latter case, the whole matter turning upon the questions
whether the child was born living or dead, and in which of these
states it was injured, it becomes necessary to prove one or the other of the
alternatives, but in abortion they are intrinsically of no importance whatever.
The only points then to be decided are, was the birth premature,
and if so, was it intentional, and if so, was it absolutely essential and to
save either maternal or fœtal life. Except as bearing on these questions,
therefore, it is of no consequence whether wounds were inflicted, whether
the lungs had been inflated, whether the fœtus was viable, or even whether
it was ever discovered.</p>

<p>In their place, however, these points are each important, but only as
bearing on the main facts to be determined. In a case, for instance, as
that related by Ollivier d’Angers, where the fœtus, though very immature,
lives several hours after its expulsion, this fact alone will preclude
the idea of a slow and progressively acting cause like most forms of abortive
disease, and will point to some direct interference, by means suddenly
terminating the pregnancy without injuring the fœtus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>And so in other cases, especially of sudden maternal death, it is of importance
to ascertain as nearly as possible the period at which death of
the fœtus took place. If the two were coincident, the deduction might
be other than if the latter were proved to have preceded the former by
several days. The differences observed between putrefaction and decomposition
<i>in utero</i> and in the open air must not be lost sight of. In the
one case, according to Orfila, Devergie and Martin, Moreau, P. Dubois,
Danyau, Cazeaux, Tardieu, and my own experience, a uniform and characteristic
reddish-brown hue obtains in proportion to the time of retention
after death, varied perhaps by the action of the amniotic fluid;<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> the
fœtus wrinkles, dries, and becomes mummified, unless in earliest pregnancy,
when it generally resolves itself into a gelatinous mass.</p>

<p>If the cervix, the portion of the uterus most frequently wounded, is
found punctured or lacerated, while the ovum is still retained, there is
reason for suspicion; if the membranes are torn and extensively detached,
while the cervix is but little dilated, such is increased; and it is made
almost a certainty, if with the latter condition, nothing remain of the
ovum in the uterine cavity but lacerated fragments. Here the abortion
would probably not merely have been intentionally induced, but by the
direct introduction and agency of instruments.</p>

<p>Wounds of the fœtus are much rarer than those of the mother, and are
usually simple pricks of the skin marked by blackish coagula or extravasations;
which, if upon the skull and unless care be used, are liable to be
simulated by clots casually adhering to the hair or scalp. If the wound be
deeper, its course may be traced by dissection. Its situation varies; Devergie
thinking it always on the back and buttocks, while Tardieu, with
some warmth, would restrict its location to the top of the cranium. This
difference is easily explained by variations in the time of pregnancy, and
in consequence partly, as may also depend on its life or death, in the presentation
of the child. The rarity of their occurrence, though denied by
Taylor<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and other medical jurists, might, however, be expected, and is
readily accounted for; the instruments used by ignorant persons seldom
entering the os, however severely wounding the cervix, and where they
do enter, usually only piercing the membranes; against which, except toward
the end of pregnancy, in a deficiency of liquor amnii, or in labor,
the fœtus can hardly be said to forcibly press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<h3>4. <i>The Identity of the Party Accused.</i></h3>

<p>Most of the points here involved having already been incidentally considered,
we will not repeat them. The circumstances and history of the
case, the relative correspondence of different testimony, the allegations of
the accused, will all bear directly upon the question at issue.</p>

<p>In trials for abortion, of all others, the medical witness and the advocate
should bear in mind their liability to error; the juror and the judge
the fact that innocent persons are at times wrongly accused, often by the
true criminals themselves.</p>

<p class="tb">In defence, it must either be pleaded that the alleged abortion did not
occur, that it was accidental or natural, that it was necessitated, or that it
was induced by another than the individual charged.</p>

<p>The first of these pleas is seldom offered except in the earliest months
of pregnancy, and would be invalid if an attempt at the abortion could
be proved. In default of this, however, where the ovum has been lost, or
has passed unnoticed, the fact that the sanguineous effusion was hemorrhagic
and attended with clots, would, in the absence of any uterine disease
sufficient to account for this, be so far presumptive evidence; to be
corroborated or not by the history of the case. Moles and hydatids are
now generally allowed to be mere transformations of the product of conception;
their premature discharge, therefore, equally an abortion.</p>

<p>In answer to the second plea, the importance of several points must be
borne in mind. It has been well put by Tardieu that it is wrong to commence,
as advised by most authorities on the subject, by enumerating all
the natural and accidental causes liable to have produced the abortion.
On the contrary, the signs and proofs of criminal violence should first be
sought, and these compared with the allegations of witnesses and the
possibility of a natural or accidental origin. The traces of falls, contusions,
and wounds must be found, not believed on mere allegation; coincidences
must be guarded against, equally with untruth.</p>

<p>We have already laid down rules here available; that the state of the
fœtus often affords proof of the cause of its expulsion, this being slow
and natural, and depending on disease and predisposition, or not; that in
flagrant malpractice, the use of alleged specifics, or of measures likely to
produce direct miscarriage, or otherwise absolutely counter-indicated by
the general health and constitution of the patient, a contradiction exists
to the plea offered, in itself strong presumptive evidence of criminal intent;
and that in certain cases this evidence becomes positive, as where,
for instance, a sponge found or proved to have been inserted into the os<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
uteri as a dilating tent, is alleged to have been intended as a mere pessary
and placed in the vagina.</p>

<p>If the accused be a physician, presumed as he should be, acquainted
with the great principles of practice, his only plea can be, where the
means used were unjustifiable and proved such, and where the pregnancy
was known to others, that he was ignorant of its existence. Liable as
the profession are at any time to this charge, and easy as it is in almost
every case, especially of instrumental procedure, for us to take such preliminary
measures as would be likely to settle the question of the existence of
pregnancy, or to request the presence of a witness to our act, it is unjust
to ourselves and to each other to omit these precautions.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, the charge be utterly unfounded, it is probable,
as I have already remarked, that contradictions in the testimony or
the alleged facts could always be shown to exist, and the perjury thus exposed.
It would be self-evident, were the accused proved to have been
first consulted after the abortion had terminated, though not if it had only
commenced.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V_ITS_PERPETRATORS">V. ITS PERPETRATORS.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is interesting, and at the same time of judicial importance to ascertain,
so far as possible, the standing and character of the perpetrators of
this crime.</p>

<p>In the first place, French statistics on the large scale show that the
number of criminals, principals and accomplices, in that country at least,
is in large excess to the instances of the crime, there having been in 183
trials, from 1826 to 1853, not merely 417 parties accused, but 213 convicted;
and that in 75 per cent. of the prosecutions and convictions
occurring, where the abortion is not induced by the mother herself, the
offenders are women.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> With us the same statement is, without doubt,
equally true.</p>

<p>The part played by the mother, herself so often a victim, is almost
always that of a principal, yet as laws now stand, she can scarcely ever be
reached. The cases where she is under duress, by threat of other personal
violence from her husband or seducer, and thus compelled to submit
to abortion, or where the act is performed by his direction but without
her knowledge, are so rare, that in a general statement they may be assumed
not to exist. If the mother does not herself induce the abortion,
she seeks it, or aids it, or consents to it, and is, therefore, whether ever
seeming justified or not, fully accountable as a principal. We have
already seen the position these mothers hold in the community, high as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
well as low, rich as well as poor, intelligent and educated as well as
ignorant, professedly religious as well as of easy belief, not single alone, but
married.</p>

<p>We turn now to their partners in guilt, more criminal than themselves;
for whatever excuse the latter may suppose themselves to possess, the former
can have none.</p>

<p>The accomplices in criminal abortion are of several classes, distinguishable
in some respects from each other, especially by the relative frequency
with which their part is played. They are:</p>

<p>In many cases, such at least is judged by the writer from his own observation,
the abortion is not merely advised, but induced by some female <i>friend</i>,
especially by one who has herself undergone, in her own person, the crime;
perhaps without appreciable evil result,—but this is not necessarily the
case, for even where such result is present and plainly in consequence, its
connection with the true cause is frequently unsuspected or disbelieved.</p>

<p>It has been said that misery loves companionship; this is nowhere more
manifest than in the histories of criminal abortion. In more than one instance,
from my own experience, has a lady of acknowledged respectability,
who had herself suffered abortion, induced it upon several of her friends,
thus perhaps endeavoring to persuade an uneasy conscience that by making
an act common, it becomes right. Such ladies boast to each other of the
impunity with which they have aborted, as they do of their expenditures,
of their dress, of their success in society. There is a fashion in this, as
in all other female customs, good and bad. The wretch whose account
with the Almighty is heaviest with guilt, too often becomes a heroine.
So true is the case, that the woman who dares at the present day publicly
or privately to acknowledge it the holiest duty of her sex to bring forth
living children, “that first, highest, and in earlier times almost universal
lot,”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> is worthy, and should receive, the highest admiration and praise.</p>

<p>The ease with which an accomplice is procured, provided the idea originates
with the victim herself, and is not suggested by another, is found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
among <i>nurses</i> to be greatly increased. We separate them as a class from
midwives and female physicians, with whom, though in this country not
generally acknowledged or thought identical, they not unfrequently aim to
be confounded. They are usually, and rightly, thought more familiar
with the laws of health and disease, than the generality of their sex; they
are, if doing their duty in his sight, seen to be treated with respect by the
physician; they are commonly of mature age, supposed discreet, wise, and
to keep their own counsel; they have had opportunities of gaining the
confidence of the mother; many of them have themselves borne families.
They are therefore approached with less hesitation, and are not always
found proof against an offered fee.</p>

<p>What we have said of nurses applies with increased pertinency to <i>female
physicians</i> and <i>midwives</i>. These make it their claim, in rivalry of the
male physician, that their schools and their practice are, like his, founded
on those abroad, especially of Paris. Tardieu shows, in a total of 32
cases occurring in that city and collected by himself, that in 21—no less
than 66 per cent., or two-thirds of the whole number reported—the crime
was perpetrated by midwives.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> This class frequently cause abortion
openly and without disguise. They claim a right to use instruments, and
to decide on the necessity and consequent justifiability of any operation
they may perform. Where they establish private hospitals, professedly
for lying-in women or not, their chances, previously great, of committing
this crime and infanticide with impunity, become more than doubled. It
has been found necessary in France for the police to exercise rigid surveillance
over these establishments. In one instance, occurring at Grenoble,
it was proved that within three years there had happened in the
house thirty-one still-births at the full time, or deaths just after birth, and
that the abortions and miscarriages had been almost innumerable.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In
another case, to conceal the evidence of these truly <i>corpora delicti</i>, and
to evade the law against secret burials, the midwife had established an
understanding and a current account with an undertaker, who was accustomed
to smuggle her fœtuses into his coffins, by the side of the corpses
confided to him for burial. In still other cases, the victims are kept on
hand, preserved in jars; private collections vieing in extent with those
of legalized obstetric museums.</p>

<p>By these remarks we would not be supposed endeavoring to excite prejudice
against female physicians and midwives, as such, or advocating their
suppression. We are now merely considering this crime of abortion, in
relation to which they are peculiarly and unfortunately situated. At present
everything favors their committing the crime; their relations to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
women at large, their immunities in practice, the profit of this trade, the
difficulty, especially from the fact that they are women, of insuring their
conviction. Let better laws be enforced, and let public opinion be enlightened
concerning the guilt of abortion, and the influence for evil of
this class of offenders will in great measure be done away with.</p>

<p>Of male abortionists we have less to say. Their number is fewer abroad,
bearing the proportion, as we have seen, of but one to every four, and
their liability of being applied to, or consulted, is slight in comparison.</p>

<p><i>Husbands</i>, though generally knowing to the offence of their wives, and
often counselling it, probably but seldom attempt its commission themselves;
yet instances of this do undoubtedly occur. In but a sixteenth of
the cases reported by Tardieu, was any compulsory violence exerted over
women by their husbands.</p>

<p><i>Druggists</i> and <i>professed abortionists</i> are accountable for the greater
number of the cases of the crime attributable to men. The latter class,
though proportionally rare, yet abound in every city, and take all means
of making themselves known. A knowledge of their alleged specifics,
against the use of which, “at certain times,” the public are “earnestly
cautioned,” etc. etc., is brought home to all our women, no matter how
purely minded, and despite every care to the contrary, through the medium
of the daily press; few papers, however professedly respectable or
religious, proving able to refuse the bribe.</p>

<p>Druggists, as a class, are little more than the confessed agents of these
villains. Even should they not directly recommend their nostrums, as,
however, is frequently the case, they almost universally keep them on sale,
labelled to catch the eye, and placarded on their walls. Like the publishers
and vendors of obscene literature, they conceive they are not to
blame for supplying a public demand, however much they themselves may
have done toward its creation.</p>

<p>And in this connection we must again allude to the guilt of the public
press, which has proved itself so constantly and so dangerously an accessory
to the crime. It would be thought that in Massachusetts, for instance,
a statute like the following might do something to check this
license:<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>“Every person who shall knowingly advertise, print, publish, distribute,
or circulate, or knowingly cause to be advertised, printed, published, distributed,
or circulated, any pamphlet, printed paper, book, newspaper,
notice, advertisement, or reference, containing words or language, giving
or conveying any notice, hint, or reference to any person, or to the name
of any person, real or fictitious, from whom, or to any place, house, shop,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
or office where any poison, drug, mixture, preparation, medicine or noxious
thing, or any instrument or means whatever, or any advice, directions, information,
or knowledge, may be obtained for the purpose of causing or
procuring the miscarriage of any woman pregnant with child, shall be
punished,” etc. etc.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The above statute, however, such is the public sentiment on this point,
is not enforced, or is daily evaded. The press, if it choose, may almost
annihilate the crime; it now openly encourages it.</p>

<p>It has been often alleged, and oftener supposed, that <i>physicians in good
standing</i> not unfrequently and without lawful justification, induce criminal
abortion. This statement, whatever exceptional cases may exist, is
wickedly false. The pledge against abortion, to the observance of which
Hippocrates compelled his followers by oath,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> has ever been considered
binding, even more strongly of late centuries. The crime is recognized as
such in almost every code of medical ethics; its known commission has
always been followed by ignominious expulsion from medical fellowships
and fraternity. If this direct penalty be at any time escaped, it is only
through lack of decisive proof, bare suspicion even of the crime insuring
an actual sundering of all existing professional friendships and ties; a loss
that subsequent proof of innocence could hardly restore. Such is the
unanimous feeling of the profession; to its credit be it said, that with
but a single exception,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and this to his eternal disgrace, its writers are
all agreed, abstractly considering the subject, on the sanctity of fœtal life.
The instances where physicians in good standing are guilty of the crime,
are of rare occurrence; the error that has prevailed on this point, originating
from the self-assumed titles of notorious quacks and knaves. But
no condemnation can be too strong for the physician who has thus forgotten
his honor; who has used to destroy life, that sacred knowledge by
which he was pledged to preserve it.</p>

<p>The criminal abuses likely to arise from the procurement of justifiable
abortion by medical men, are so numerous, their own liability to be thought
by the public criminally careless of fœtal life, or skeptical concerning its
existence, is so great, that the subject is worthy special consideration.
This I shall now devote to it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI_ITS_INNOCENT_ABETTORS">VI. ITS INNOCENT ABETTORS.</h2>

</div>

<p>We have referred to an apparent disregard of fœtal life, obtaining in
the medical profession, as a prominent cause of the prevalence of criminal
abortion. We now proceed to show that the opinion is not unfounded.</p>

<p class="tb">Premature labor, or obstetric abortion, may be justifiably induced by the
physician for one of two reasons; either to save the life of the mother or
that of her child. In each case it must be, absolutely and only, to save a
life.</p>

<p class="tb">Performed for the child’s sake, it is evident that the operation can be
only available during the last three months of pregnancy, for then only
can the fœtus with any degree of probability be considered viable. We
grant that there are a few cases on record where, born during the sixth
month and even in the fifth, the child has survived; but it is equally certain,
despite the popular notion concerning the mortality of eighth-month
children, that the later the operation can be safely delayed, the better the
chance for the infant’s life.</p>

<p>The rules for the induction of premature labor must, of course, vary for
different cases. In this early stage of the inquiry, it is perhaps impossible
to state them precisely, but they may still be approximately arrived at.</p>

<p>1. The operation, performed for the child’s sake, is but seldom required;
and in general,</p>

<p>(2.) only after the commencement of the seventh month of pregnancy.</p>

<p>3. It must be clearly indicated; and</p>

<p>(4.) must be delayed as long as is consistent with the child’s safety.</p>

<p>5. Its means must be those which are most efficient, and safest for the
child.</p>

<p>We have already stated that the induction of abortion before the
seventh month, undertaken for the child’s sake, must be generally useless;
and therefore, as attended with some degree of danger to the mother,
generally unjustifiable. As the profession are nearly united on this point,
its further discussion is here unnecessary.</p>

<p>We have asserted that the cases where prematurely induced labor is
required for the child, are comparatively rare. We now add that while
in some respects they are more frequent, in others they are less so than is
generally supposed. To necessitate it, there must be disease or deformity
on the part of the mother, or disease on the part of the fœtus or its appendages.</p>

<p>It is most frequently performed to avoid the alternative of craniotomy,
the necessity of which, unless extreme, can manifestly only be known with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
certainty, before the expiration of pregnancy, from the experience of past
labors. But here too much caution cannot be exercised; the rules of the
books and of accepted authorities are not to be blindly followed.</p>

<p>Craniotomy at the full time is still too frequently performed:</p>

<p>Where it has been suggested by the character of a previous labor,
children are often, or might be, born living;</p>

<p>Where it seems indicated by direct exploration, as ruled even by recent
writers, children are sometimes, or might be, born living;</p>

<p>Where it was formerly thought absolutely essential, the progress of obstetric
science has now rendered it often unnecessary.</p>

<p>It is proper that we consider these points, for they bear directly on the
question at issue concerning criminal abortion.</p>

<p>It is known that the sex of children exercises an appreciable influence
upon the result of labors at the full time, as regards the possibility of
their passing alive, unaided or at all, through the pelvis, and as regards
the length of the labor, which also progressively endangers the life of the
mother and their own; the average female fœtus, in cases at all difficult,
having the advantage over the male by its inferiority in size, especially
important in the cranial diameters. It is unnecessary for us to do more
than refer to the facts by which these assumptions are proved.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Where,
therefore, craniotomy has been found necessary in a former labor, the
child then being male, in another labor a female fœtus may often pass uninjured.
However this argument may be lessened in value by the impossibility
of previously ascertaining the sex, it is strengthened in the doctrine
of chances, by the number of the labor and the sex of the former children;
and by the fact that first labors are generally most difficult, whatever
the sex of the child.</p>

<p>Furthermore, cases will suggest themselves to most practitioners of experience,
in which from difference in the character of the labor or without
apparent reason, children are born living at the full time, males, of large
size, and presenting by the vertex, where craniotomy had previously, perhaps
repeatedly, been performed. An instance of this has occurred to
the writer, where the patient had been advised to early abortions from
alleged physical incapacity of ever bearing living children; he delivered
her, without difficulty, of a large-sized and living boy, at the full time.</p>

<p>Again, it may happen that in labor at the full period, craniotomy may
seem decidedly indicated and advisable, but for one reason or another
may not be performed, and yet the child, unaided, be born living. The
writer’s experience furnishes him with two illustrations of this class: one
of them occurred in 1851, the patient his own, Drs. S. sen., and C., in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
consultation; the other was seen at Edinburgh, in 1854, in the practice
of his friend, Dr. G. W. In both cases, permission was refused to operative
procedures, the patients being Catholic, and the physicians unable
conscientiously to pronounce the fœtus already dead, while the possibility
of intra-uterine baptism was not recollected; in both instances the children
were born living, and without instrumental aid.</p>

<p>In other cases, where from deformity previously diagnosticated, craniotomy
is pronounced necessary if the patient should go her full time, she
may do so, the labor be unassisted, and the child yet escape with its
life. I instance a remarkable case for some time under my own charge
at the Boston Lying-in Hospital, delivered by one of my colleagues, Dr.
Dupee, and subsequently reported by Dr. Read.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The pelvis was here
equably contracted, and to a great degree, but from some difference of
opinion, partly as regarded the justifiability of premature labor as compared
with craniotomy, the patient was allowed to go her full time. Both
mother and child did well.</p>

<p>Finally, by turning, the use of the long forceps and of anæsthesia, children
are now constantly saved, where formerly craniotomy and their consequent
destruction would have been absolutely indicated. These processes,
with the introduction of each of which as an alternative a single
name is imperishably connected, are now successfully employed by very
many of the profession;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> they have each of them saved to the writer the
disagreeable necessity of fœtal destruction. Where, however, one life
is thus preserved, there are still multitudes unnecessarily, and, therefore,
unjustifiably, sacrificed.</p>

<p>The comparative frequency of craniotomy in the different countries of
Europe is in this connection worth noticing.</p>

<p>The remarkable difference between the practice on the continent and in
England, so suggestive to us in this country, is undoubtedly owing to the
fact that in Catholic States greater value is attached to the life of the
child than “in Protestant States, as Britain, where the child is always
sacrificed to save the mother.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The immense excess of embryotomy
cases in Catholic Dublin furnishes no exception to this rule, drawn as
they are from hospital practice under Protestant control.</p>

<p>So far proof by deduction. In many cases involving the question of
craniotomy, that operation is not required; in some of them, not even
the induction of premature labor.</p>

<p>Two classes of cases remain, each affording more direct evidence;
those where craniotomy being absolutely indicated if the patient were
allowed to go her full time, that operation is, and those where it is not
performed.</p>

<p>Craniotomy, being necessarily fatal to the fœtus, is indicated only to
save the mother’s life; to be avoided when any other alternative giving the
fœtus a chance of life, and not more than equally hazardous to the mother,
can be resorted to. Especially is this the case when it is compared
with the induction of premature labor, attended as is the latter, despite a
certain amount of danger of its own, with great probability of saving the
child, and with decidedly lessened risk to the mother; for craniotomy not
merely requires the use of murderous instruments, dangerous to all tissues
they may approach or be in contact with, but the operation is usually,
though often very improperly, delayed till late in labor, and therefore till
the mother’s chances of recovery have been proportionally lessened. Premature
labor, on the other hand, though of course involving some risk to
the child, is not necessarily fatal to it; nor is it usually so, when properly
performed. That there is a choice in this respect between the means employed,
will hereafter be shown.</p>

<p>Craniotomy, when absolutely indicated at the close of pregnancy, must
be for one of two reasons: that the fœtus cannot pass through the
pelvis at the full time alive, though it may do so unmutilated, the operation
being performed to save the mother the greater risks of protracted
labor; or that it cannot pass at the full time unmutilated, even when dead.
We defer the consideration of another supposable instance, where the
fœtus in the outset of its viability may pass, but not alive, for this pertains
to the consideration of the mother’s safety alone, no alternative
availing for the child. In the other cases, if the necessity could be
learned in season, from the previous history of the patient or by pelvic
exploration, labor should most certainly be prematurely induced, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
affording some positive chance of life to the child, and as less dangerous
to the mother. It were here worse than foolish, if not criminal, blindly
to imitate nature, when, her course being obstructed, she would kill the
child.</p>

<p>I have alluded for a double reason to cases, fortunately few, where craniotomy,
and much more decidedly premature labor being indicated, the
practitioner decides from the outset to perform neither, to give his patient
or her child no aid. Such conduct is as cruel and wicked as it is unprofessional,
and were not instances occasionally reported, its existence could
hardly be believed. We acknowledge with Blundell the evils of meddlesome
midwifery, but there are extremes to all things; certainly to the
powers of nature and the limits of justifiable delay.</p>

<p>I am aware that I have referred to a reported case, which might in this
connection be quoted against the opinion now expressed; but even by its
exceptions do we prove the rule. Where chances are so greatly against
both mother and child as in these cases if left unaided, it would be the
office of the physician, were there no better procedure, by craniotomy to
save the one;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> but at the present day it is no less plainly his duty, where
possible, to anticipate labor, and thus save both. I have elsewhere discussed
this question at some length,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and can only repeat, as is indeed
allowed by Churchill,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that this is no matter on which to select one’s
words; the deliberately sacrificing an unborn, but still living child, in cases
where statistics go to prove that the adoption of another mode of delivery,
nothing counter-indicating, would give that child a good chance of
successful birth, is nothing short of <i>wilful murder</i>, no matter by what
schools or by what eminent men it may be sanctioned, and it should be
branded as such by the profession.</p>

<p>But, undertaken for the child’s sake, not merely should premature
labor be resorted to for the purpose of preventing craniotomy, but often
in cases of incurable disease, acute and chronic, of the mother, where it
is evident that she must inevitably, or even probably, perish before the full
period of pregnancy has been attained. Instances of such acute disease<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
will readily suggest themselves. The question here is merely between the
operation under consideration, the Cæsarean section, and doing nothing.
The last, suppose the fœtus viable and to be still living, would in many
instances be decidedly unprofessional and unjustifiable. Cæsarean section
after the mother’s death is comparatively unsuccessful; and before it, is
so much more severe and in all probability so much more quickly fatal,
that the other should be preferred, unless death be already close at hand.</p>

<p>Instances of chronic incurable disease necessitating the induction of
premature labor, may not so readily occur to the mind. The shock of an
abortion being frequently greater to the maternal system than that of labor
at the full time, it is evident that this rule cannot be universally applied.
It cannot in every case of thoracic disease, of the heart, for example,
unless its own peculiar symptoms become so aggravated from progressing
pregnancy as to render probable earlier decease of the mother, the operation
then being performed partly on her account; not so much to save her
life as to delay a little her death. But there are other and extreme
cases, as cancer of the lower segment of the uterus, or indeed of its fundus,
which may have been diagnosticated previously to pregnancy by the
use of expansible tents, or of my uterine dilator hereafter referred to,
where the mother would probably perish in labor at the full period, with
most probably the loss of the child also. Here, by premature labor, the
child may be saved, and the mother’s life, greater expansion of the uterus
and its more probable laceration being prevented, possibly prolonged.</p>

<p>So far complications on the part of the mother necessitating premature
labor for the sake of the child. There are others equally imperative,
afforded by itself. Excessive size of the fœtus in comparison with a normal
pelvis, as evidenced and rendered probable by previous labors, is
hardly of less importance in connection with craniotomy, than where the
pelvis is distorted or contracted, and the fœtus of natural size; but the
operation in question, as compared with premature labor, we have already
sufficiently discussed.</p>

<p>Diseases of the placenta, congestive, inflammatory or degenerative, are
no less an indication, where known to exist, for an early delivery. Their
diagnosis may be difficult, but yet not wholly impossible. The occurrence
of the same disease in past labors, and evident intra-uterine disturbance
as discovered by auscultation or by unnaturally frequent and strong fœtal
movements, are, taken together, frequently sufficient to establish the fact.
The impropriety of allowing such cases to proceed unaided, cannot be too
strongly insisted upon. By early delivery, if the fœtus have formerly
perished after the period of viability, and in addition, by special medication
of the parent, if its death had usually occurred before that time, many
valuable lives might annually be saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>Premature labor as resorted to on the mother’s behalf alone, putting
aside the cases we have incidentally considered, where the lives of both
herself and her offspring are of necessity taken into account, includes also
its induction in the earlier months of pregnancy before the fœtus is viable.
It may be required by diagnosticated malformation or monstrosity of the
fœtus and by malformations on the part of the mother; by extreme pelvic
contraction, congenital or from rickets or malacosteon, preventing the natural
passage of a fœtus after viability, by tumors incapable of elevation
or displacement, by contraction of the vagina, or by other severe obstetric
complications, either recent or of long standing. Of this last class of
causes, obstinate vomiting, puerperal convulsions, which are by no means
confined to the full period of pregnancy, dropsies, irreducible displacements
of the uterus, varix of the external labial vessels, sometimes fatal
by laceration from tension, are all instances in point. With regard to
each, the necessity of the abortion must be determined with the greatest
caution, and resort be had to it, the child still living, with reluctance;
especially should this be the case if the complication be supposed on the
part of the fœtus, so important is it to avoid its sacrifice, if possible, and
the semblance of disregarding its own important claims.</p>

<p>The rules for the operation when performed for the mother are the same
as when for the child, save that if absolutely required, it may be resorted
to at an earlier period. If the child must necessarily be lost, the labor
should not be long delayed.</p>

<p class="tb">There are several subordinate questions arising in this connection,
neither metaphysical nor merely casuistic, but practical, and because bearing
on the increase of criminal abortion, directly involving human life to
an indefinite extent. One of them we shall now mention.</p>

<p>Let physical incapacity to the birth of a living or viable child through
the natural passages be supposed to exist on the part of the mother; that
this has been proved by examination, or by the result of a former labor,
induced or at the full time. To save the mother’s life, early abortion is
once brought on and the child destroyed; the woman and her husband
being of course informed of the true state of the case. Is it right or
justifiable, again to destroy the fœtus, and as often as sexual lust may repeat
impregnation? Or should the patient be left to the risks of a subsequent
Cæsarean section, which would at least give the chance of life to
her child?</p>

<p>I am aware on which side of this question lies at present the opinion
and the practice of the mass of the profession; that Nægele<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and others<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
have ruled it right always to destroy the fœtus when a refusal to undergo
the Cæsarean operation shall have been formally expressed by the mother;
and that reports of instances where early abortion has been repeated, even
to nine times upon the same patient, are still unblushingly published by
men of the standing of Lever and Oldham.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>But, on the other hand, in his late admirable justification of craniotomy
where absolutely necessitated, Churchill makes use of the following language,
which though offered in another connection, is none the less pertinent
here: “It is the due appreciation of these relative responsibilities
(regarding mother and child) in difficult cases, that distinguishes the wise
and experienced accoucheur; he preserves a just counterpoise between
them so long as it is possible to fulfil both, and recognizes the proper moment
when one ceases. <i>One</i>, I say, not <i>either</i>; for I protest against the
notion that <i>we choose which of the two lives we shall save</i>, a notion
as false in theory as it is in practice. <i>No man dare make such a choice</i>,
for we have neither the necessary knowledge, nor the right, nor the authority,
to decide which is the more important life and best worth preserving.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>“My own opinion is that such a course (the repetition of abortion)
ought not to be adopted, but that pregnancy should be allowed to proceed,
without interruption, to the full period; and when labor declares
itself, that the infant should invariably be extracted by the Cæsarean section,”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
which, when performed in season, is by no means necessarily fatal
to the mother, and may preserve life to the child.</p>

<p>The question now so plainly put, is one for the profession soberly to
discuss and to answer.</p>

<p class="tb">We have already shown that in many cases where instrumental delivery or
the induction of premature labor is apparently requisite, the mother, if a Catholic,
is sacrificed to the supposed impossibility of administering the right
of baptism to the child. We do not, with some, allow that the physician
is here justified in deliberately and falsely asserting the child’s death, where
such has not taken place, but we have revived the suggestion of a method
by which this great and fundamental obstacle may be overcome. We
assert that the negligence too often shown by physicians in these cases,
the custom of practically leaving the mother and her child to their fate
when instrumental delivery shall have been refused upon religious grounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
sincerely entertained,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> is, however wide it may appear from the point,
directly incentive to the increase of criminal abortion. Provided the
question of necessity is determined, but one course in these cases should
be pursued, and that the performance of intra-uterine baptism.</p>

<p class="tb">The objections usually made to the induction of premature labor,
namely, the uncertainty of all pelvic measurements and of the exact
period of gestation, the greater liability to malpresentation, and, from the
uninvoluted state of the cervix, to the evils of a lingering labor, lose
much of their force when tested by our preceding remarks. If resorted
to, the means of its induction are various, and, as regards their justifiability,
they present a decided choice. We here omit the consideration of the
methods indirect or of doubtful efficacy, as draughts, general or local
baths or bleedings, forced exercise, fatigue, and voluntary falls or blows,
so frequently resorted to by the uneducated, or used, in addition to other
procedures, by the designing to mask the reality; these will be subsequently
considered, and we confine ourselves, in comparing the other
and more direct methods, only to ascertaining that which is safest and
most efficacious, for these points alone can decide their respective justifiability.</p>

<p>The direct and reliable means of inducing abortion, in the physician’s
possession, are only instrumental. Draughts of all kinds, whether purgative,
emmenagogue, or so-called specific,—aloes, ergot, or savin,—or energetic
poisons, expelling the fœtus through a sudden and profound disturbance
of the whole maternal system, as arsenic or cantharides, are too
unreliable, unscientific, or dangerous either to mother or child. The justifiable
methods are confined to those acting directly on the uterus and its
contents, by dilating the os or detaching the membranes.</p>

<p>They are, rejecting the local application of belladonna as utterly inert:</p>

<p>1. Local or distant and sympathetic irritation</p>

<ul>
<li>By the hand;</li>
<li class="isub1">medicinal applications;</li>
<li class="isub1">electricity or galvanism.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Puncture of the membranes, and evacuation of their fluid contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>3. Dilatation of the os, and separation of the membranes from the
uterine walls</p>

<ul>
<li>By sponge tents;</li>
<li class="isub1">the introduction of instruments;</li>
<li class="isub1">or the injection of fluids.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first of these modes, in all of its applications, is extremely uncertain
in effect.</p>

<p>The second, though that usually attempted, is of real avail only toward
the close of pregnancy, and is even then decidedly inferior to the last of
the methods proposed; at an earlier period it is probably unjustifiable.
In thirteen cases reported by Lever and Oldham,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> where labor was prematurely
induced by puncturing the membranes, only four of the children
were born living, and in all these the presentation was by the vertex. It
has been shown that malpositions are much more frequent in earlier than
later pregnancy, and from evident causes, the comparative absence and
weakness of the fœtal movements which govern its position in utero, and
the want of correspondence in form between itself and the containing organ.
Of the nine cases reported where the fœtus was dead, five presented
by the vertex, and were therefore probably alive at the commencement of
labor, as after death previous to labor, malposition very generally occurs,
except there be deficiency of the liquor amnii or the pregnancy have
advanced to near its close.</p>

<p>Again, it appears from the same statistics, which as offered for another
purpose are the more to be depended upon, that in the successful cases,
where the child was born living, the length of time after the operation
and before the occurrence of pains, almost doubled that in the unsuccessful
cases, where the child was lost; the sum of the hours in the four successful
cases exceeding the sum in the nine unsuccessful ones. That is to
say, in the one class of cases time was allowed for a certain amount of
dilatation of the os and cervix and for some degree of detachment of the
membranes, an approach, however slight, to the characters of normal
labor; and in the other cases the labor was brought on at once, without
either of the above processes having commenced, and when both uterus
and its contents were totally unprepared. Had the times, moreover, from
the commencement of labor to its close, been given in the two classes of
cases, it would probably have been found that the relative proportions
were reversed; that the sum of the hours in the unsuccessful cases exceeded
that in the successful cases, as would be in strict accordance with
the results to the fœtus.</p>

<p>In premature labor, as in that at the full period, the bag of waters is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
required to be preserved until it has fulfilled its purpose, on the one hand,
of a fluid wedge, and on the other, of protection to the child from violence
till it has fairly entered the pelvic brim. Puncture is also attended
with the danger of directly wounding the uterine tissues.</p>

<p>The last of the methods referred to, dilatation and detachment, combined
to a certain extent as they must necessarily be, is in close imitation
of the processes observed in natural labor, and is recommended alike by
its safety to mother and child, its certainty, and the ease both to physician
and patient with which it may be effected.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p class="tb">From the above remarks it is evident that the profession need to exercise
great caution lest they directly, though unintentionally, become the
abettors of criminal abortion. But this liability is not confined to the
instances already mentioned, where abortion has been intentionally induced.
Nor is the matter in question one affecting merely the public health and
morals, like prostitution or syphilization. It is a liability directly to
increase the unjustifiable destruction of human life, and its existence cannot
be too strongly impressed upon our minds and guarded against.</p>

<p>So true is this, that two of the French obstetricians, Moreau and Bégin,
have not hesitated to express their fears, and not on religious grounds
alone; the latter, with Tardieu, giving it as his conviction, that every
physician should make a legal declaration of the act to the public prosecutor,
immediately on inducing premature labor, even if the period of viability
has been reached by the fœtus. The subject has also been discussed
by the French Academy of Medicine;<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and in Great Britain it has been
referred to by Radford, in whose opinion an enactment is necessary, “entirely
prohibiting obstetric abortion (before the period of viability), as the
door for evil purposes is already too open, and would be still more so, if it
was legally decided that where performed on supposed obstetric grounds,
no inquiry should be made.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Whenever an abortion is induced by a physician, even if accidentally,
it is liable to be thought intentional by the patient and her friends, and
consequently by the community, so far as it becomes aware of the fact.
Instances of this are within the writer’s knowledge.</p>

<p>Accidental abortions, caused by a physician, may be from two causes:
error or insufficient care in diagnosis, or the absence of all likelihood of
the existence of pregnancy. When cases are reported in apparent innocence
of fault, and by eminent practitioners, of the pregnant uterus having
been tapped for ovarian dropsy; of craniotomy having been attempted
upon an infant’s fundament instead of its skull, and of the same operation
in another instance undertaken upon the promontory of the mother’s
sacrum, it cannot be alleged, I care not by whom, that this caution is unnecessary
or these fears unfounded. The writer will state a few cases that
have happened under his own observation. He has twice known abortion
to be accidentally occasioned by the use of sponge tents;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> the patients
being near the close of their menstrual lives, and neither themselves nor the
physicians in attendance supposing that the contents of the enlarged uterus
could be fœtal; in one of these cases the woman had never before been
pregnant, and in the other not for many years. He has twice known the
introduction of an intra-uterine pessary to be followed by abortion; in
neither case was there any probability of the existence of pregnancy, save
in the fact that the patients were married. He has known abortion to be
produced by the application of lunar caustic to the os, in a case where,
from the character of the operator, no suspicion could be entertained of
the uterus having been more deeply tampered with.</p>

<p>In cases like these, the practitioner would seem to render himself liable
to the charge of malpractice, even though by the improbability of malicious
intent he escaped that of criminal abortion. In all instances where
there exists the slightest suspicion or possibility even of pregnancy, the
only rule for operative interference must be, unless circumstances imperatively
prevent, to wait the few months or weeks necessary to establish the
diagnosis. Justice to the profession and to the risk of error demand that
where such precaution is not had, it should be replaced by a consultation,
which would at once dispel any suspicion of carelessness or malpractice,
and prevent a criminal charge.</p>

<p>All that we have said regarding surgical obstetrics, applies as forcibly
to its medicinal procedures. Though draughts and potions of every kind
are, as we have remarked, of doubtful or indirect efficacy for inducing
abortion, yet with some of them instances of its occurrence do at times
result. In supposed obstructive amenorrhœa, unless of several months<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
standing, and in early pregnancy where established, the physician who
does not intend it, must take care lest accidentally or carelessly, by purging,
vomiting or over-bleeding, he produce a miscarriage.</p>

<p class="tb">But there is still another point in this connection we must not pass over.
We state it in the following inquiries, received from one of the most eminent
practitioners of the Eastern States, and put to us in all sincerity.</p>

<p>“Are there not cases where a physician would be justified in suggesting
a course such as he would use in amenorrhœa, even where he might <i>suspect</i>,
but not <i>know</i>, the existence of pregnancy? Suppose a mother of
several children, which she has had in rapid succession, and the physician
feels assured that health, and possibly life, will be endangered if another
pregnancy occurs; would he be criminal if he were to use common means
for amenorrhœa if the menses have been absent six weeks? Are the cases
always so plain that a man can decide, and may he not balance a choice of
evils?”</p>

<p>Covering as these questions do, much of the ground already gone over,
we may answer them at once, and decidedly in the negative. They apply
more especially to the early months of pregnancy, where it is always impossible
to know its existence; and were direct or probable emmenagogues,
or instrumental interference, to be here allowed, criminal abortion might
be always induced before quickening, sanctioned and permitted by the
rules of medicine. To justify abortion, life must certainly or very probably
be endangered, not possibly merely, which is true in every pregnancy,
and might be alleged at every trial for the crime.</p>

<p>Hufeland advised, as a “golden rule,” always to suppose the existence
of impregnation in such cases, and to act accordingly; that is, to temporize
long enough for the fœtus, if present, to make its sign. “Thereby,”
he says, “the physician will avoid much mischief, and preserve his conscience
as well as his reputation.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The ideas on this subject held by my friend, are without doubt widely
entertained by the profession. This paper will have served a good purpose
and have saved many fœtal lives, if it do no more than carry conviction
of the error and its likelihood to indefinitely extend the crime.</p>

<p class="tb">Again, it is undoubtedly the case that in all cases of maternal death
during pregnancy, where the fœtus has arrived at the period of viability,
its immediate extraction by the Cæsarean section should be effected. We
have already referred to this subject, and Kergaradec, who has well written
upon it, lays down the maxim that the operation should always be performed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
even in the fifth month of pregnancy.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> In some cases, of placenta
prævia, for instance, where the chances are always more or less
against the child’s life, success is less probable; but this in no wise invalidates
the necessity of the operation. The writer has himself performed
it in the complication instanced, and in vain; but he would none the more
hesitate, on this account, to repeat it. There can be no reason against
the procedure in any case, and by it the child may possibly be saved. In
the words of an older writer, “Est enim inhumanum, post obitum matris,
fœtui pereunti et suffocari parato manus auxiliares denegare, et sæpè viventem
adhuc cum matre mortuâ eodem tumulo contegere et obruere.
Idcirco jurisconsulti eum <i>necis</i> reum damnant, qui gravidam sepelierit
non prius extracto fœtu.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>A question has been raised concerning the rights of relatives in preventing
the physician from such discharge of his duty. It has been
asserted that “the father has not only the natural right of his relationship,
but legal power; for Dr. Lever recently mentioned that he had consulted
Dr. Alfred Taylor to know whether he would be justified in performing
Cæsarean section after the death of the mother, without the consent
of the father, as it appeared unjustifiable homicide to allow the infant
to die. Dr. Taylor gave his opinion that, in law, the infant belonged to
the father,—the infant with the life thereof,—and that if Dr. Lever
touched it, even to rescue it from death, an action would lie against him.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
I must, however, declare such doctrine to be false and pernicious. If
signs of the child’s life remain, no physician should hesitate endeavoring
to preserve it, unless restrained by actual force. I reiterate my conviction
that such neglect, or seeming neglect, of fœtal life is an actual wrong,
both against the individual and against society.</p>

<p>Similar points in which physicians are directly interested, as tending by
their apparent disregard of fœtal life to render themselves innocent abettors
of criminal abortion, are not uncommon. Such are neglect of efforts
to prevent miscarriage when threatening, or where it has become an established
habit; and of attempts at resuscitating still-born children where
there is the slightest chance of success, and success has now been rendered
much more probable by the methods of Marshall Hall and Silvester; the
performance of operations of any kind upon a pregnant woman, even
tooth-drawing,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> that might be delayed; the careless or unnecessary use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of ergot; the relying upon a single and unaided opinion, where not one
life only, but two, may be endangered.</p>

<p>Other instances might be adduced; but enough has already been said to
prove that the importance of the subject we are considering, and the
responsibilities resting upon the profession regarding it, demand as I have
elsewhere suggested,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> that physicians should possess, should acknowledge,
and should govern themselves by, an <i>Obstetric Code</i>—the necessity of
which will be made even more manifest, as we proceed in our investigation
of questions pertaining to Obstetric Jurisprudence. We have referred to
some of its leading principles, but have done no more than faintly foreshadow
them.</p>

<p>Distressing in the retrospect, inconvenient frequently in the present,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
such a Code would undoubtedly prove; but it is demanded of the profession
by the progress of our science, by humanity, morality and religion.
Were the facts in the case more generally known, and the existence and
sanctity of fœtal life more universally appreciated, it would be also
demanded by public opinion.</p>

<p>We have now seen that “the absurd enactments still remaining on the
statute book, the careless indifference with which society views the crime,
the reluctance with which means are adopted to prevent its occurrence, its
increase, and its frequent induction by obstetricians, are all evils which
loudly and imperatively call for the closest investigation.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>We proceed to the other relations of criminal abortion, more especially
to those immediately pertaining to the claims and course of justice.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII_ITS_OBSTACLES_TO_CONVICTION">VII. ITS OBSTACLES TO CONVICTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>We have already seen that there are special, though, it is to be hoped,
not wholly insurmountable causes for the existing prevalence of abortion.
It now becomes our duty to consider some of these reasons in detail, in
so far as they relate to and obstruct the course of justice.</p>

<p>It would seem, from what has been previously said, that little doubt
could be entertained of the inefficacy of our present statutes against abortion.
There are few of the States whose laws on this point are so wisely
and completely drawn as in Massachusetts; yet, as they there stand, they
cannot, as such, be enforced. In that Commonwealth, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
reports of the attorney-general, during the eight years from 1849 to
1857, omitting 1853—as there seems to have been no report rendered for
that year—there were, as we have seen, 32 trials for abortion, and not a
single conviction!</p>

<p>A committee of the State Medical Society of Massachusetts, to whom
the propriety of a professional appeal to the Legislature for more protective
statutes had been referred by the District Society of Boston, having
reported against such action, on the ground “that the laws of the Commonwealth
are already sufficiently stringent, provided that they are executed,”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
it becomes the more necessary for us to strike at the root of the
whole matter, and to show, if possible, why conviction, unless in case of
the death of the mother, cannot at present be obtained.</p>

<p>It has been thought, even publicly argued, that in the fact that statutes
against abortion are almost everywhere not only not enforced, but not attempted
to be enforced, there is afforded strong evidence of the existence
of an ultimate and absolute impossibility of thus meeting the crime. The
idea, though a fallacious one, is yet attributable to an important and
evident cause.</p>

<p>That the prevalence of abortion is in great measure owing to ignorance
of guilt, on the part of the community at large, we have shown. We now
assert that its futile prohibition by the law, its toleration, are plainly in
consequence of similar ignorance on the part of legislators, and of officers
of justice.</p>

<p>Our communities form their own laws, and, therefore, as was pointed
out at the commencement of our remarks, these must necessarily bear the
stamp of public opinion; while the officers by whom they are to be enforced—juror,
attorney, judge—looking to the only source possible for their
enlightenment on this subject, to medical men, have hitherto found but
few bold and honest statements,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and these unindorsed by the mass of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
profession; or, in the total silence, a practical sanction of the popular
belief. This is no exaggeration; the assertion is fully borne out by facts.
Need we wonder, then, that the laws are not enforced, that indeed their
enforcement is not attempted? But this first and great cause, it is
apparent, is by no means an essential one.</p>

<p>We need add nothing to what we have already said, of those obstacles
to conviction, arising from circumstances common in greater or less degree
to other crimes;—the difficulties of detection and of obtaining proof,
however great these are allowed to be,—but we proceed at once to consider
the laws themselves by which in this country the crime of abortion
is attempted, or is expected to be suppressed.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The arguments by which we have shown the mistaken premise on which
the common law of England, as covering this crime, is founded, and by
adoption, the common law of this country, will not have been forgotten.
We shall perceive that similar reasoning applies with equal force to the
special statutes, where such exist, of almost every State in the Union.</p>

<p class="tb">In the following States, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Iowa, and the District of Columbia, there appear
to exist no statutes against abortion, and the crime can only be reached
at common law and by the rulings of the courts.</p>

<p>In the case of the District of Columbia, all rulings are based on the
common law, the old English statutes, from Elizabeth to George II., and
the old colonial statutes of the Province of Maryland, down to 1800, the
period of cession to the United States of that portion of Maryland lying
on the north side of the Potomac, now included in the federal district.</p>

<p>The later English statutes, even those of George IV., being enacted
subsequent to the separation from the mother country, are not recognized
in the District. In the State courts, so far as the rules and principles of
the common law are applicable to the administration of criminal law, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
have not been altered or modified by acts of the colonial or provincial
government, or by the State Legislature, they have the same force and
effect as laws formally enacted.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> In the States referred to, therefore, as
having no special statutes of their own, the later English statutes, though
not of absolute force, are to a certain extent undoubtedly acknowledged.</p>

<p class="tb">By the common law of England, as stated by Blackstone:—</p>

<p>“If a woman is quick with child, and by a potion or otherwise, killeth
it in her womb, or if any one beat her, whereby the child dieth in her
body, and she is delivered of a dead child, this, though not murder, was
by the ancient law homicide, or manslaughter. But the modern law doth
not look upon this offence in quite so atrocious a light, but merely as a
heinous misdemeanor.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> “But if the child be born alive, and afterwards
die in consequence of the potion or beating, it will be murder.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>By this law it is necessary to furnish proof not merely of pregnancy,
but of quickening; no one besides the mother can be reached, save in the
rare instance of beating; it is often impossible to prove that a child, born
living, has died in consequence of means used upon itself or its mother
before the birth.</p>

<p class="tb">The Ellenborough act,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> passed in 1803, runs thus:—</p>

<p>“If any person shall willfully and maliciously administer to, or cause to
be administered to, or take any medicine, drug, or other substance or
thing whatsoever, or use, or cause to be used or employed, any instrument,
etc., with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, not being,
or not being proved to be, quick with child at the time of committing
such thing, or using such means, then, and in every such case, the persons
so offending, their counselors, aiders and abettors, shall be and are
declared guilty of felony, and shall be liable,” etc. etc.; if before quickening,
to fine, the pillory, stripes, or transportation; if after quickening, to
death;—but in the clause providing for the latter case, mention of instruments
was omitted.</p>

<p class="tb">Punishment was thus extended to the crime prior to quickening; and
besides the actual perpetrator, to those counseling and assisting therein.
For its commission after quickening, capital punishment was restored;
but by a strange oversight, no penalty was provided for the cases occurring
at this period, where the abortion was induced by instrumental or
other mechanical violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>To remedy this defect another act, that of Lord Lansdowne,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> was
substituted in 1828:—</p>

<p>“If any person, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman
then being quick with child, unlawfully and maliciously shall administer
to her, or cause to be taken by her, any poison or other noxious thing, or
shall use any instrument, or other means whatever, with the like intent;
every such offender, and every person counseling, aiding or abetting such
offender, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof, shall suffer
death as a felon;” if the woman were “not, or not proved to be, then
quick with child,” the offence was still felony, and punished by transportation,
or imprisonment and stripes.</p>

<p>By this enactment, the mistaken belief in a difference of guilt, according
to the period of fœtal life, was still retained. For which reason, and
in the false hope that by again abolishing capital punishment, juries would
more frequently decide in accordance with fact, the English law has later,
and during the present reign, still further been modified and rendered
more just, simple, and comprehensive.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p class="tb">“Whosoever, with the intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman,
shall unlawfully administer to her, or cause to be taken by her, any
poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument, or
other means whatsoever, with the like intent, shall be guilty of felony, and
being convicted thereof, shall be liable,” etc. etc., to transportation or
imprisonment.</p>

<p class="tb">By the present English statute, the woman herself can hardly yet be
reached; many convictions must still be lost from failure to prove the
agent either a poison or noxious thing; in other respects, however, it
is well drawn. Attempts at the crime are covered, and proof is not
required of pregnancy, or of actual injury to the mother.</p>

<p class="tb">So far the instances in this country of an absence of special statutes.
Where such exist, they may be variously classified. Reserving for a
little all other considerations, we find them at once falling into four
great divisions.</p>

<p>I. Those acknowledging the crime only after quickening has occurred:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Connecticut,</li>
<li>Mississippi,</li>
<li>Arkansas,</li>
<li>Minnesota,</li>
<li>Oregon.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>II. Those acknowledging the crime throughout pregnancy, but supposing
its guilt to vary with the period to which this has advanced:—</p>

<ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Texas.</span>—“If any person shall designedly administer to a pregnant

the penitentiary not less than two, nor more than five years; if it be done
without her consent the punishment shall be doubled.</p>

<p>“Any person who furnishes the means for procuring an abortion,
knowing the purpose intended, is guilty as an accomplice.</p>

shown that such means were calculated to produce that result, and shall
receive one half the punishment prescribed.</p>

<p>“If the death of the mother is occasioned by an abortion so produced,
or by an attempt to effect the same, it is murder.</p>

<p>“If any person shall, during parturition of the mother, destroy the
vitality or life in a child, which child would otherwise have been born
alive, he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for life, or
any period not less than five years, at the discretion of the jury.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to apply to the
case of an abortion procured or attempted to be procured by medical
advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">California.</span>—“Every person who shall administer or cause to be administered
or taken, any medicinal substance, or shall use, or cause to be
used, any instrument whatever, with the intention to procure the miscarriage
of any woman then being with child, and shall be thereof duly convicted,
shall be punished by imprisonment in the State prison for a term
not less than two years, nor more than five years; provided, that no
physician shall be affected by this section, who, in the discharge of his
professional duties, deems it necessary to produce the miscarriage of any
woman in order to save her life.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p class="tb">IV. The State, like England, where proof of pregnancy is not required:<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indiana.</span>—“Every person who shall willfully administer to any pregnant
woman, or to any woman whom he supposes to be pregnant, anything
whatever, or shall employ any means with intent thereby to procure the
miscarriage of such woman, unless the same is necessary to preserve her
life, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding
twelve months, and be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p class="tb">The impossibility of proving the existence of pregnancy, in all cases of
early occurring, and in many of advanced abortion, save by its result, is
undeniable. Quickening, where abortion is criminal, is seldom previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
ascertained by witnesses, at least from actual examination. If
the mother is dead, her own testimony, not often willingly given, is lost,
and the only reliable evidence that the usual period of quickening had
been reached, is from the body of the fœtus, frequently concealed or
destroyed. The law requires, in proof of the existence of quickening,
that the woman should herself have felt the child move within her;<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
thus discarding<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> the distinction once very properly made by a learned
judge, “Quick with child, is having conceived; with quick child, is
where the child is quickened.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>We have already sufficiently insisted on the error, injustice, and actual
wrong to society, of making this absurd distinction between the fœtus of
an early and a later age, and only refer to it at the present time as foremost
among the existing obstacles to conviction.</p>

<p>In some of the States, the offence is considered a trifling one, except as
affecting the person or life of the mother; this is the case in New Hampshire,
Vermont, and Massachusetts. In Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Oregon, the proved death of either child or mother is required
to make abortion a high misdemeanor, felony or manslaughter;
while in Virginia and Arkansas it is necessary to constitute an indictable
offence, in the one State that the death of the child should be proved, and
in the other that this or its premature discharge has actually taken place.
An attempt at the crime would here seem beyond indictment, unless
fœtal life were destroyed; though if this could be proved, the attempt
might perhaps be reached, even though the fœtus were retained in utero,
and a true abortion, its discharge, had not taken place. In Maine, the
fœtus must have died before birth; if, born living, it yet die in consequence
of the abortion, the crime would seem not indictable, save at common
law. In other States, allowing the fact of pregnancy to be proved,
and in Indiana alone this is not necessary, attempts at abortion are as indictable
as the act consummated, save in Texas, where the means used
must be shown to be such as “were calculated to produce the result.”</p>

<p>In but few instances is the crime, intrinsically considered, accounted a
heinous one, and recognized in its true character—an attempt to destroy
the life of the child. In Texas, the consent of the mother half palliates
the crime; while in very many codes abortion is omitted from the list of
offences against the person, and accounted only a breach of public decency
and morality.</p>

<p>In Ohio, as we have seen, it is called a high misdemeanor; in New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
York, Michigan, Oregon, Arkansas, and Mississippi, it is styled manslaughter
in the first degree. The punishment inflicted by the latter of
these States, however, is ridiculously trivial, and in all of them proof of
quickening is required. In New York it has been determined that under
an indictment for procuring the abortion of a quick child, which by the
revised statutes is a felony, the prisoner may be convicted, though it turn
out that the child was not quick, and the offence therefore a mere misdemeanor;<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
as in the remaining States it is indeed either in name or by
penalty considered,—a simple, trivial, and venial offence.</p>

<p>But it must not be forgotten that the true nature of manslaughter consists
in the absence of all malice or willful intent, expressed or implied, to
do personal injury: out of tenderness to the frailty of human nature,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> the
law mercifully denying to such homicide, from unlawful accident or hasty
passion, the same degree of guilt with the cool, deliberate act;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> nor that
misdemeanors are specifically confined to the following category: disturbances
of the public peace, trivial personal injuries, public nuisances
and scandals, lewdness, and incentives to special crimes.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> It is evident
that under neither of these heads can the crime of abortion be properly
made to fall.</p>

<p>Difficulties of conviction, similar to those we have seen obtaining in
England, and arising from requirement of proof that the means employed
are unlawful, also present themselves in several of our States, though in
most they have been wisely avoided. In Vermont and Massachusetts the
agent administered, to be indictable, must have been a “poison, drug,
medicine, or noxious thing;” in Illinois, a “poison, noxious, or destructive
substance, or liquid;” in Texas, a “drug or medicine;” and in California,
a “medicinal substance.” In Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut,
New York, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, Virginia,
Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, the wording of
the statute is sufficiently comprehensive; while in Indiana, there is used
the curt but significant expression “anything whatever,” it not being
necessary under this statute, in an indictment for administering medicine
or any other substance, to procure abortion, for the agent to be described
as noxious, or even its name to be stated.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The use of instrumental and
other violence is generally well provided against.</p>

<p>The truth is, as has indeed been ruled, that it should not be necessary
to show, in pleading or evidence, that the drug, etc. administered is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
noxious or the like, the intent to procure abortion being the gist of the
attempt;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and if a person administer a bit of bread merely, with this
intent, it is sufficient to constitute the offence.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> On the other hand, it has
been laid down, that if the thing administered could of itself by no possibility
produce the abortion, and it were proved that this fact were known
to the person administering, the crime would not have been committed;
on the ground that he must be presumed to have acted without the malicious
intent which the law requires.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Here, however, the frequent and
important physiological effect through the imagination, in producing a
definite result where such is supposed to be intended, has been entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>In several States, a seemingly unwise discrimination has been made by
the law between the various methods employed. Thus in Michigan, Mississippi,
Arkansas, and Minnesota, a special statute has been enacted for
cases where the crime is effected “by any injury to the mother, which
would be murder if it resulted in the death of such mother.” We have
seen that the surest and most efficient means of producing abortion are
those where no injury whatever is necessarily inflicted upon the mother.
Such statutes as the above, therefore, actually tend to encourage the
crime.</p>

<p>Another important obstacle to conviction is found in the latitude the
statutes allow, generally by omission, to the plea of justification.</p>

<p>In Illinois and Louisiana no justification whatever is allowed by the
law. In Connecticut the offence is penal where committed “willfully and
maliciously;” in Vermont and Massachusetts to the latter of these expressions
are added the words, “or without lawful justification:” but in
each case, decision upon this point is left in great measure or wholly to the
court. In Virginia, to be allowable, the abortion must have been necessary
for the life of either the mother or child. In Maine, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Minnesota, California, Oregon,
and the Territories of Kansas and Washington, it must have been performed
for the sake of the mother’s life alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>In none of these States is a standard of such justification established by
the statute. In Maine, New York, Indiana, Alabama, Oregon, and the
Territory of Washington, this is not even attempted. In Texas, the
statute acknowledges “medical advice.” In Missouri, Mississippi, California,
and the Territory of Kansas, the sanction of “a physician” is allowed
as excuse; in Arkansas that of “a regular physician;” in New Hampshire,
Ohio, Michigan, and Minnesota, “two physicians” may decide on
its necessity; but in every one of these States, the word “or” stands
engrossed upon the statute, and thereby the precaution is practically
invalidated; which could not have been the case had the word “and”
have been used instead.</p>

<p>The truth is, as we have seen, that when such latitude is allowed by the
law, it is inevitably abused. Medical evidence, medical sanction, and
medical performance are absolutely essential for excuse in every case; if
the opinion of a single physician is allowed to be sufficient, an escape is
afforded for all instances where this privilege has been dishonored; the
word “regular” is much more liable to be misinterpreted than the word
“competent;”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> in every case before abortion can be justified, its necessity
should previously have been decided and the possibility of crime thus
prevented, by a consultation of at least two competent medical men.</p>

<p>We have pointed out many circumstances under which premature labor
is demanded, by the rules of humanity and of medicine, for the sake of
the mother’s life, and have seen that in several States it is for this cause
allowed. But we have also shown that it is often equally necessitated for
the sake of the child. In no State save Virginia is its justifiability for
this purpose yet recognized by the statute law.</p>

<p>By the codes of most States, the mother is not punishable, however directly
implicated in the crime. New Hampshire, New York, and Wisconsin,
are apparently the only exceptions to this statement; the last
two of them also not requiring proof of pregnancy for conviction, while
by implication New Hampshire does.</p>

<p>By the statute of Indiana, all other women equally with the mother
would seem released from prosecution, the word “he” being used of the
persons indictable. The same oversight is noticed in the first section of
the statute of Texas.</p>

<p>Objections were formerly made, especially in England, to the severity
of the penalties then inflicted, (death in case of quickening, transportation
or long imprisonment otherwise,) on the erroneous ground that this severity
was wholly disproportionate to the guilt of the offence, and that, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
juries did not convict. The mistaken character of this supposition is
shown by abundant proof in this country. In many States the penalties
of the law are absurdly insignificant, tending, equally with the uncertainty
of their infliction, to encourage the crime, and yet the same difficulties of
conviction prevail. The true nature of these difficulties we have endeavored
in great measure to explain, and we think it will have appeared
that however numerous and serious they may be, they are yet not insuperable.</p>

<p>Before concluding this subject, it is proper that we examine more fully
into the doctrine of the common law, to understand more precisely its
meaning. In so doing, we shall quote freely from the leading authorities
of the day, especially those of this country.</p>

<p class="tb">The destruction of an unborn child is not at the present day murder at
the common law, though such was formerly the case;<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> to constitute
which crime, the person killed must at the time of death have been alive,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
as we have shown the fœtus to be from the time of conception, and
“a reasonable creature in being,”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> a quality in this connection denied to
the child by the law, though in all other relations it inconsistently allows
and affirms it; as it does also, and always, from the moment of birth, even
though the funis is undivided and the placenta still attached.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>To cause abortion after quickening, is not, as such, murder or manslaughter
at common law, but a high misdemeanor.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Whether to cause, or to attempt, abortion before quickening is a penal
offence at common law, has been differently decided. In several of the
States, as Maine, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, it has been ruled by
the Supreme Court not to be indictable, even as an assault, if done with
the consent of the woman; on the ground that only in case of high crimes
is the person assaulted incapable of assenting.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The Pennsylvania court,
however, has discarded this doctrine, and has decided that the moment
the womb is instinct with embryo life, and gestation has begun, the crime
may be perpetrated.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>The distinction alluded to with regard to quickening, is allowed by an
acknowledged legal authority<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> to be at open variance not only with
medical experience, but with all other principles of the common law.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
The civil rights of an infant in utero are respected equally throughout
gestation; at every stage of which process, no matter how early, it may
be appointed executor,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> is capable of taking as legatee<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> or under a marriage
settlement,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> may take specifically as “a child” under a general
devise,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and may obtain an injunction to stay waste.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>When, in an attempt to procure an abortion, there is an evident intent
to produce the death of the mother, and her death does actually occur,
such attempt becomes murder at common law;<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> but when nothing more
is intended than to commit the misdemeanor, it is only manslaughter,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
being an instance of homicide from individual malice toward a third
party, when the fatal blow falls on the deceased by mistake. It has been
said, however, that this last is not the true doctrine, the destruction of an
infant in utero being, even at common law, in some respects felonious, and
the act in its nature malicious and deliberate, and necessarily attended
with danger to the person on whom it is performed.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The use of violence upon a woman, with an attempt to produce her
miscarriage without her consent, rules Chief Justice Shaw, of Massachusetts,
is an assault highly aggravated by such wicked purpose, and
would be indictable at common law. So where, upon a similar attempt,
the death of the mother ensues, the party making such an attempt, with
or without her consent, is guilty of murder, on the ground that it is an
act done without lawful purpose, dangerous to life, and that the consent
of the woman cannot take away the imputation of malice, any more than
in case of a duel, where in like manner there is the consent of the
parties.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Though to kill the fœtus in utero is as such, by the common law, no
murder, yet if it be born alive, and die subsequently to birth from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
wounds it received in the womb, or from the means used to expel it, the
offence becomes murder in those who cause or employ them.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> If a person,
intending to procure abortion, does an act which causes the child to
be born earlier than its natural time, and therefore in a state much less
capable of living, and it afterwards die in consequence of such premature
exposure, the person who by this misconduct brings the child into the
world, and puts it into a situation in which it cannot live, is guilty of
murder, though no direct injury to the child be proved; and the mere
existence of a possibility that something might have been done to prevent
the death, does not lessen the crime.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The earlier English statutes, from their peculiar phraseology, held
pregnancy essential for the commission of the crime,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> yet an attempt to
produce abortion is now indictable at common law,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> though it fail by
reason of the woman being, in fact and contrary to the belief of the party,
not pregnant.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> For though as no man would attempt what he absolutely
knew he could not in fact perform, nor would be deemed in law to have
so attempted, and as every one being conclusively presumed to understand
the law, no man can legally intend what is legally impossible, the rule as
to facts is different; for men are not conclusively held by the law to know
facts. And if a man fails in what he undertakes, because of an impossibility
in fact, which he did not know, he is just as answerable as if the
failure were from any other cause.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>We have seen the mistaken basis, as regards the criminality of abortion,
on which the common law is founded, and that while it recognizes
the distinct existence of the fœtus for civil purposes, it here considers its
being as totally engrossed in that of the mother.</p>

<p>A recent authority thus accounts for and defends the mistake. The
wealth and prosperity of the country, it is assumed, and the growth and
efficiency of its population, are alike matters of general concern, and therefore
the law takes them under its care. As to population, there are in
civil jurisprudence such rules, as that the husband may hold the lands of
his deceased wife during his life, if before her death a living child was
born, but not otherwise; the law thus offering, in effect, a reward for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
issue. It does not compel matrimony, because that would be an infringement
of private rights; but for the same end, it does punish abortions.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Another writer has also implied that the common law, in making
fœticide penal, had in view the great mischiefs which would result from
even its qualified toleration: namely, the removal of the chief restraint
upon illicit intercourse, and the shocks which would be sustained thereby
by the institution of marriage and its incidents; among which the delicacy
of women.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>In unison with these opinions, Judge Coulter, of Pennsylvania, has
ruled, that “it is not the murder of a living child which constitutes the
offence, but the destruction of gestation.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p class="tb">If our previous assumptions of the actual character of criminal abortion
be granted, and we believe that they have been proved to a demonstration,
it must follow from the subsequent remarks that the common
law, both in theory and in practice, is insufficient to control the crime;
that in many States of this Union, the statutory laws do not recognize its
true nature; that they draw unwarrantable distinctions of guilt; that
they are not sufficiently comprehensive, directly allowing many criminals
to escape, permitting unconsummated attempts, and improperly discriminating
between the measures employed; that they require proofs often unnecessary
or impossible to afford; that they neglect to establish a standard
of justification, and thereby sanction many clear instances of the
crime; that by a system of punishments wholly incommensurate with
those inflicted for all other offences whatsoever, they thus encourage instead
of preventing its increase; and that in many respects they are at
variance, not merely with equity and abstract justice, but with the
fundamental principles of law itself.</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped,” has forcibly been written, “that the period is not
far remote, when laws so cruel in their effects, so inconsistent with the
progress of knowledge and civilization, and so revolting to the feelings
and claims of humanity, will be swept from our statutes.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>In a similar trust, it now behooves us to consider whether, and in what
manner, the difficulties in the way of generally suppressing the crime of
abortion can be overcome.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII_CAN_IT_BE_AT_ALL_CONTROLLED_BY_LAW">VIII. CAN IT BE AT ALL CONTROLLED BY LAW?</h2>

</div>

<p>To this important question I do not hesitate to give an unqualified
answer in the affirmative. The fact that criminal abortion is not controlled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
by law anywhere, cannot be entertained as a valid argument to
the contrary of this assertion; for it is equally the fact, as we have seen,
that laws against abortion do not as yet exist, which are in all respects
just, sufficient, and not to be evaded.</p>

<p>It is evident that in aiming to suppress this crime, the law should provide
not merely for its punishment, but indirectly as well as directly, and so
far as possible, for its prevention. The punishment of a crime cannot be
just, if the laws have not endeavored to prevent that crime by the best
means which times and circumstances would allow,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and this is to be
accomplished by a twofold process: by rendering on the one hand its
detection more probable, and on the other its punishment more certain.</p>

<p>As indirect though important measures for the former of these ends,
we have already mentioned laws for registration,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and against concealment
of births and secret burials. As a single proof of their possible influence
in this respect, out of many that might be adduced, we instance
the fact that in Paris the number of premature fœtuses deposited at the
Morgue, during the nine years, from 1846 to 1854, inclusive, was found
to exceed by more than two-thirds that of the full decade just preceding,
from 1836 to 1845.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> To render this difference more apparent, we have
compiled the following table:—</p>

<table summary="Age of fœtuses deposited">
  <tr>
    <th>Age of fœtuses deposited.</th>
    <th>Ten years:<br />1836-1845.</th>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Part of this advance, it is true, is attributable to the increase in the
population of Paris, and in the prevalence of criminal abortion, but in
great measure it is clearly owing to the enforcement of a more rigid law
against secret burials. The above remarks are strikingly corroborated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
by the fact that of trials for the crime, and we must not forget that these
bear but a small ratio to the whole number of cases preliminarily investigated,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
there were in France, during the latter of these periods, fully four
times the number occurring from 1836 to 1845.</p>

<p>The establishment of foundling hospitals, by the State governments,
has been urged as a preventive of the crime, and, on the other hand, fears
have been expressed lest the same means should increase it. For ourselves,
however, and from some experience in such cases, we believe that
these fears are groundless, and that with equal justice might they be entertained
of every large charity having for its end the improvement,
sanitary or otherwise, of the masses of society.</p>

<p>We have quoted a statute existing in Massachusetts, though practically
unenforced, against one great agent in the increase of abortion, an abuse
of its license by the public press. Were such laws to become general,
and to be faithfully executed, and were it also made penal to sell any
drug, popularly known as emmenagogue, except as advised by physicians,
just as the sale of direct poisons is, or should be, controlled
by law, the present system of openly advertising by abortionists would
undoubtedly be brought to a close.</p>

<p>In no matter is it of more importance than in cases of suspected criminal
abortion, that coroners should be intelligent and well educated medical
men; and we could wish that this point might have received especial
attention from Dr. Semmes, in his late admirable report to the American
Medical Association.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In the sudden excitement of an inquest, the guilty
are more likely than at a later period to be off their guard, and evidence
may often be elicited at this time, which, at the subsequent trial, it would
be impossible to obtain. There can be no question of the importance of
this point; the coroner should be skilled in all that pertains to obstetric
jurisprudence; and if similar knowledge were more generally possessed
by other officers of justice, attorney, juror, and judge, a far greater number
of convictions, under a proper law, would be secured.</p>

<p>As regards the more direct statutes, we have already considered their
important points.</p>

<p>“In order to render laws effectually preventive,” has wisely been said,
“they should be consistently framed, and based on justice.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> In accordance
with this truly axiomatic doctrine, and with various rulings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
courts, already quoted, no proof should be demanded which is not necessitated
by the actual character of the crime. We have seen that neither
in intent nor in fact is this an attempt against the person or life of the
mother. If she die in consequence, the offender is already amenable for
it as homicide; in the absence of any special statute, at common law.
The crime, both in intent and in fact, is against the life of the child.</p>

<p>The attempt being proved, it is unnecessary that it should have been
consummated, not merely the completion of a crime bringing its punishment,
but also certain overt acts with intent to the perpetration; nor is
it requisite that any injury, specific or general, should have been inflicted
upon the person of the mother.</p>

<p>The offence being of equal guilt throughout pregnancy, proof of
quickening, the incident, not the inception of vitality,—indicating neither
the commencement of a new stage of existence, nor an advance from one
stage to another,—<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and, therefore an element without the slightest intrinsic
value, should not be required.</p>

<p>The crime of abortion should be considered to include, as it does in the
absolute fact of moral guilt, all cases of attempted or intentionally effected
destruction and miscarriage of the product of impregnation; and this,
whether it be living or dead, normal or abnormal, which last expression
equally comprehends instances of moles, hydatids, extra-uterine conception,
acephalous, anencephalous, and other monsters.</p>

<p>Proof should not, as now, be required of intent to destroy the child.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
This should be considered shown by the intent to produce miscarriage, in
the absence of lawful justification therefor; the act in all stages of pregnancy
being attended with great danger to the child, and, in much more
than a moiety of the period, necessarily fatal to it.</p>

<p>The attempt being considered criminal, it follows that proof of pregnancy
is not necessary, and that conviction should be had though it were
proved that pregnancy did not exist,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> even that the woman on whom the
abortion was attempted, however unlikely, was still a virgin.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>No discrimination should be made as to the means criminally employed,
and an escape thus afforded to the guilty; as we have seen still obtaining
in Great Britain and many of our own States.</p>

<p>The mother, almost always “an accessory before the fact,” or the
principal, should not, as now, be allowed almost perfect impunity. There
is no valid reason for such exemption, there is every reason against it. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
woman is covered by the laws of most continental nations of Europe,—France,
Austria, Germany, Bavaria, and Italy,—and by many of them
her punishment, if married, is greatly increased. Similar severity is also
exercised in these countries against the father of the fœtus, if he too is
implicated in the crime.</p>

<p>To allow that abortion is extenuated in the unmarried, it has been said,
will “to the moral and political philosopher appear to have exalted the sense
of shame into the principle of virtue, and to have mistaken the great end
of penal law, which is not vengeance, but the prevention of crime. Law,
which is the guardian and bulwark of the public weal, must maintain a
steady and even rigid watch over the general tendencies of human actions.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
But, on the other hand, “the measure of punishment should be proportionate,
as nearly as possible, to the temptation to offend, and to the
kind and degree of evil produced by the offence.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>We have seen the increase in moral guilt, and of opportunity for commission
and for escape, in the case of nurses, midwives, and other classes
of persons, who, from their profession, are brought more directly into
contact with pregnant women. By the penal code of Napoleon the First,
remarkable in so many respects for the wisdom of its provisions, an
increase of punishment was enacted for abortion criminally induced or
advised by physicians, surgeons, or other officers of health, including
midwives, or by druggists;<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> their guilt being enhanced by their greater
opportunities and knowledge.</p>

<p>Punishments for the crime of abortion should not, as is now generally
the case, be so framed as to render the statute, in fact, if not in name,
simply nugatory. Were the murder of adults to be made answerable by
merely a year or two in prison, far more convictions than at present
would undoubtedly be secured; but it is certain that the instances of the
crime would be fearfully increased. We have reason to believe that it is
precisely thus with the case in hand.</p>

<p>A standard of justification for the instances of necessary abortion
should be fixed by law. If perfection in this respect be impossible, let
the nearest approach be made to it that can. Since my remarks upon
the relative rights of the mother and fœtus to the chance of life in doubtful
cases were published in a former paper of the present series, I have received
from Dr. Rattenmann, late of Tübingen, an essay, written by himself,
in which this question is discussed at length, and the repetition of abortion
upon the same individual, in the early months of pregnancy, is defended.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
I have carefully considered the several arguments advanced by the gentleman,
and am compelled to adhere to the views I have already expressed.</p>

<p class="tb">In presenting a report upon the matter, in 1857, by direction of the
Suffolk District Medical Society of Massachusetts, the writer offered the
draft of a law, prepared after much thought and consultation with legal
as well as with medical men, and embodying the suggestions made above.
This was intended for the consideration of the Legislature of the State, in
the hope that it might be of aid toward a modification of the present
defective law.</p>

<p>Having seen no reason to change the opinions then avowed, but, on the
contrary, receiving constant confirmation of their truth, I now present the
essential portions of that draft, acknowledging most willingly that its
wording may, perhaps, with safety, be simplified and condensed; but
contending, in all sincerity and earnestness of purpose, that its general
tenor is what justice and humanity alike, and imperatively, demand at the
hands of society.</p>

<p>“Whoever, with intent to cause and procure the miscarriage of a woman,
shall sell, give, or administer to her, prescribe for her, or advise, or
direct, or cause, or procure her to take any medicine, or drug, or substance
whatever, or shall use, or employ, or advise any instrument, or
other means whatever, with the like intent, unless the same shall have
been necessary to preserve the life of such woman, or of her unborn child,
and shall have been so pronounced (in consultation) by two competent
physicians; and any person, with the like intent, knowingly aiding and
assisting such offender or offenders, shall be deemed guilty of felony,”
etc. etc.; “and if such offence shall have been committed by a physician,
or surgeon, or person claiming to be such, or by a midwife, nurse, or druggist,
such punishment may be increased at the discretion of the court.”</p>

<p>“Every woman who shall solicit, purchase, or obtain of any person, or
in any other way procure, or receive, any medicine, drug, or substance
whatever, and shall take the same, or shall submit to any operation or
other means whatever, or shall commit any operation or violence upon
herself, with intent thereby to procure a miscarriage, unless the same
shall have been by two competent physicians (in consultation) pronounced
necessary to preserve her own life, or that of her unborn child, shall be
deemed guilty,” etc. etc.; “and if said offender be a married woman, the
punishment may be increased at the discretion of the court.”</p>

<p>It was also advised that the encouragement of criminal abortion, by
publication, lecture, or otherwise, or by the advertisement, sale or circulation
of such publication, should be made penal, and that the present well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
worded statute against the personal advertisements of abortionists, and
their nostrums, should be rigorously enforced.</p>

<p>To the words now quoted were added, and they are still applicable, the
following:—</p>

<p>“We have aimed at a statute, which, while it better defined this
atrocious crime, and covered the usual grounds of escape from conviction,
established also the proper standard of competence in all medical questions
involving issues of life and death. We believe that it would be the
means of preventing much of the present awful waste of human life. But
enforce such a law, and the profession would never allow its then high
place in the community to be unworthily degraded; nor, as now, would
those be permitted, unchallenged, to remain in fellowship, who were
generally believed guilty, or suspected even of this crime.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>In the same belief, strengthened by nearly three years careful reflection,
that criminal abortion can, to a great extent, be controlled by law, if but
the community so will, we proceed to the last division of our subject, and
discuss the duty of the medical profession toward the ultimate suppression
of the crime.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX_THE_DUTY_OF_THE_PROFESSION">IX. THE DUTY OF THE PROFESSION.</h2>

</div>

<p>I have stated that the prevalence of criminal abortion is in great
measure owing to a seeming neglect of fœtal life on the part of medical
practitioners, and that in other degree it is attributable to ignorance by
the community of the actual character of the offence, an ignorance of
physiological facts and laws; and on both these points abundant proof
has been afforded of the truth of my assertions.</p>

<p>I have also stated that medical men, in all obstetric matters, are the
physical guardians of women and their offspring; a proposition that none
can deny.</p>

<p>We have seen that unjustifiable abortion, alike as concerns the infant
and society, is a crime second to none; that it abounds, and is frightfully
on the increase; and that on medical grounds alone, mistaken and exploded,
a misconception of the time at which man becomes a living being,
the law fails to afford to infants and to society that protection which they
have an absolute right to receive at its hands, and for the absence of
which every individual who has, or can exert, any influence in the matter,
is rendered so far responsible.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, therefore, it becomes the medical profession
to look to it, lest the <i>whole</i> guilt of this crime rest upon themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>And, in the first place, it might be asserted with some truth, that such
is indeed the case. For, on the one hand, it was from physicians, as is
proved by early medical literature, that the mistaken notions, both of the
law and of the people, regarding intra-uterine vitality, were derived;
and on the other, the apathy and silence still existing on this subject
among medical men, though thousands and hundreds of thousands of
human lives are thus directly at stake, and are annually sacrificed, can only
be explained on one of two suppositions,—either that we do not yet really
believe in the existence of fœtal life, though professing to do so, or that we
are too timid or slothful to affirm and defend it. By the one alternative
a gross lie seems proved; by the other a degrading and strange inconsistency.</p>

<p>But, I believe, this apparent negligence proceeds only from ignorance
of the real duty of the profession. It is my aim, while setting forth a
deliberate and carefully prepared opinion upon this point, to inspire, if
possible, in my fellow-practitioners throughout the land, somewhat of the
holy enthusiasm sure in a good cause to succeed despite every obstacle,
and an earnest, uncompromising hostility to this result of combined error
and injustice, the permitted increase of criminal abortion.</p>

<p>Enough has already been said to show that there is need of increased
vigilance on the part of medical men, lest they themselves become innocent
and unintentional abettors of the crime.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> If, on the other hand, the
community were made to understand and to feel that marriage, where the
parties shrink from its highest responsibilities, is nothing less than legalized
prostitution, many would shrink from their present public confession
of cowardly, selfish and sinful lust. If they were taught by the speech and
daily practice of their medical attendants, that a value attaches to the
unborn child, hardly increased by the accident of its birth, they also
would be persuaded or compelled to a similar belief in its sanctity, and to
a commensurate respect.</p>

<p>But it is asked, is our silence wrong? Is there not danger otherwise
of increasing the crime? These are the questions not of wisdom, or prudence,
or philanthropy, but of an arrant pusillanimity. Vice and crime,
if kept concealed, but grow apace. They should be stripped of such
protection, and their apologists, thereby their accomplices, condemned.
Answers, however, are ready at hand to the questions proposed.</p>

ignorance? It would be far more effectually done by some bold and
manly appeal, than by the scattered influence of honorable practitioners

delaying exposure and attempting relief?</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The question of criminal abortion is doubtless one of extreme difficulty;
it is not, however, beyond the reach of the enlightened prudence
and the firm will of the authorities. It is a subject of such vital import
to society in general, that we feel convinced it cannot but awaken the
anxious thought of the persons who, from their position, are entrusted
with the application of the laws and the control of public morals.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whoever shall succeed in fixing upon it the attention it deserves,
“has taken a stand in this matter alike creditable to his head and his
heart, and we feel that he will receive the hearty thanks of every true
physician.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The increasing prevalence of infanticide,” which is but rare compared
with criminal abortion, “its dangerous moral influence, the apathy with
which so many regard its spread, and the very considerable difficulty in
obtaining conviction, call loudly for reform. The question is one of national
importance.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With this view of the case before us, I suggest it as our imperative
duty to direct the attention of legislators to the importance of enacting
a statute in conformity thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such are the confessions, independently given, of high-minded and
honorable medical men. No more can be added, no less would have
been true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>It must be granted, then, that a bold and manly utterance of the truth,
combining as this must, contradiction of the error and denouncement
of the crime, should be made by the members of the profession on every
occasion. By this course it is plain that a healthier moral tone would be
made to prevail in the community, the crime would become of rarer
occurrence, and the laws, such as they are, would be more faithfully
attempted to be enforced.</p>

<p>But it has been shown that the laws on the subject of criminal abortion
are radically imperfect and defective, and that this is attributable, wholly,
to a medical cause. We assert, therefore, that not only is it the duty of
the profession as individual components of society, but more especially
as medical men, to see them amended, and to leave no means untried, no
effort unmade, for the attainment of this end.</p>

<p>“Physicians alone,” says Hodge in his Introductory Address, “can
rectify public opinion, they alone can present the subject in such a manner
that legislators can exercise their powers aright in the preparation of
suitable laws; that moralists and theologians can be furnished with facts
to enforce the truth upon the moral sense of the community, so that not
only may the crime of infanticide be abolished, but criminal abortion properly
reprehended, and that women in every rank and condition of life
may be made sensible of the value of the fœtus, and of the high responsibility
which rests upon its parents.”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>It has been stated, indeed publicly avowed by a medical body,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> that
when a physician “shall become cognizant of any attempt unlawfully to
procure abortion, either by persons in the profession or out of it, it shall
be his duty immediately to lodge information with some proper legal
officer, to the end that such information may lead to the exposure and
conviction of the offender.”</p>

<p>This doctrine is doubtless true to a great extent, but it cannot be applied
to the confidential disclosures of patients themselves, which no man
has a right to reveal, unless constrained by the direct command of the
court, at which, it has been ruled, even professional secrets must be
divulged.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p class="tb">It follows, from the evidence we have now adduced, that if it be the
duty of the profession to urge upon individuals the truth regarding this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
crime, it is equally their duty to urge it upon the law, by whose doctrines
the people are bound; and upon that people, the community, by whose
action the laws are made.</p>

<p>And this should be done by us, if we would succeed in suppressing the
crime, not by separate action alone, but conjointly, as the profession,
grandly representing its highest claim,—the saving of human life.</p>

<p>Every step toward this end should be hailed with enthusiasm. The
late action of the State Society of Massachusetts, directly resulting from
professional agitation of the subject, deserves praise and imitation; the
body referred to having passed a series of resolutions to the following
effect: “That the Fellows of the Massachusetts Medical Society regard
with disapprobation and abhorrence all attempts to procure or promote
abortion, except in cases where it may be necessary for the preservation
of the mother’s life; and that no person convicted of such attempt, can,
consistently with its by-laws, any longer remain a fellow of the society.”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>But the mere passage of resolutions in disapproval of this horrible and
so rapidly increasing crime is not sufficient to effect its abatement.
Something more is wanted than the testimony of record books, the pointless
vote of a board of councillors. There must come a hearty, earnest,
and unanimous voice from the mass of the profession; an assertion that
criminal abortion, or at least its permitted commission, shall no longer
exist.</p>

<p>Too much zeal cannot be shown by physicians in relieving themselves
from the weight of responsibility they may have incurred by innocently
causing the increased destruction of human life. Let it not be supposed
by the public that there is among us, either in theory or practice, any
disregard of the unborn child. If such impression have already obtained,
from our own negligence, the falsehoods of irregular practitioners, or
otherwise, it should at once be removed. Fœtal life ever is, and ever has
been, held sacred by all respectable physicians, and whenever criminal
abortion has been known to have been advised, perpetrated or abetted by
one claiming our honorable name, he has invariably and at once lost all
professional standing.</p>

<p>We have seen that it is no trifling matter, this awful waste of human
life. It is a subject that demands the best efforts of the whole profession
as a body and as men. The crime, no longer practiced in secret, must
be met boldly; and met with unanimity, it will be met successfully.</p>

<p>But whether these efforts are to be at once decisive or not, whether
they are to be received with the gratitude of the community or its disfavor,
is no concern of ours. Our duty is very plain; it is to stand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
irrespective of personal consequences, in the breach fast making in the
public morality, decency, and conscience, and, to the best of our strength,
to defend them.</p>

<p>It might be, it very likely would be, for our immediate pecuniary interest,
as a profession, to preserve silence; for we have shown that abortions,
of all causes, tend to break down and ruin the health of the community
at large. But to harbor this thought, even for a moment, were
dishonorable. “I will never set politics against ethics,” said Bacon,
“for true ethics are but as a handmaid to divinity and religion.”</p>

<p>We must take this decided stand, there is no choice; else we are recreant
to the high trust we have assumed, and to ourselves. Whether
the suppression of abortion be effected or no, one thing is certain, our
own hands will have been cleansed of this sea of blood. We shall have
declared our abhorrence and our innocence of the crime.</p>

<p>Longer silence and waiting by the profession would be criminal. If
these wretched women, these married, lawful mothers, aye, and these
Christian husbands, are thus murdering their children by thousands,
through ignorance, they must be taught the truth; but if, as there is
reason to believe is too often the case, they have been influenced to do
so by fashion, extravagance of living, or lust, no language of condemnation
can be too strong.</p>

<p>Let us, then, meet the issue earnestly and boldly. Silence and patient
expectance have been fairly tried; the disease is not self-limited; the
evil, instead of working its own cure, has assumed a gigantic, an awful
growth.</p>

<p>Abstract discussions of this matter, by ourselves, and within the closed
doors of our several societies, no longer avail. We are all agreed upon
the guilt of abortion; we ever have been. Our prayers for its suppression
have not been answered, for they have hitherto been offered with inactive
hand.</p>

<p>We should, as a profession, openly and with one accord appeal to the
community in words of earnest warning; setting forth the deplorable
consequences of criminal abortion, the actual and independent existence,
from the moment of conception, of fœtal life. And that the effort should
not be one of words merely, we should, as a profession, recommend to the
legislative bodies of the land, the revision and subsequent enforcement of
all laws, statutory or otherwise, pertaining to this crime,—that the present
slaughter of the innocents may to some extent, at least, be made to cease.
For it is “a thing deserving all hate and detestation, that a man in his
very originall, whiles he is framed, whiles he is enlived, should be put to
death under the very hands and in the shop of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>In conclusion; a committee, consisting of Drs. Blatchford, of New
York, Hodge, of Pennsylvania, Pope, of Missouri, Barton, of South
Carolina, Lopez, of Alabama, Semmes, of the District of Columbia,
Brisbane, of Wisconsin, and the writer, was appointed by the National
Medical Association, at its meeting at Nashville, in 1857, to report upon
criminal abortion, with a view to its general suppression. The report of
this committee, brief, but in strict accordance with the series of papers
now ended, has lately been made to the Association, at its session held at
Louisville, in May of the present year. The report was accepted, and
the resolutions appended to it<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> were <i>unanimously</i> adopted.</p>

<p>In behalf of the committee, of whom he had the honor to be chairman,
the writer cannot close this portion of his labors without thanking the
physicians of the land, represented as they are by the Association, for
their hearty and noble response to the appeal that has been made them.
He would express, were it possible, the gratitude not of individuals, but
society; for by this act the profession has again been true to “its mighty
and responsible office of shutting the great gates of human death.”</p>

the case with laws based on mere statistics, especially, as here, where reports
to the registry are liable, for evident reasons, to be withheld. Thus it appears from
Dr. Jewell’s collections (this Journal, March, 1857, p. 277,) that the proportion of
still-births in Philadelphia was, in 1856, only 1 in 913 to the total population, and 1 in
20.1 to the general mortality, against which evidence must be placed that which we
subsequently furnish from Prof. Hodge.</p>

five (3.13 per cent.) resulted entirely from the increase of births in a permanent
population, the number of births of 1855 (in the districts where the ratio of the registered
deaths to the population was greater than one to sixty-three, 166 of the 331
towns) would have been 24,457, instead of 23,481, the number registered. On the
other hand, had the increase resulted wholly from migration, (the annual number
of births in the permanent population being constant,) the number of births would
have been only 22,956. The number of births registered is somewhat nearer the
latter than the former of these two values.</p>

<p>“Assuming the correctness of the births, deaths, and population, in the selected
districts, it appears that 35 per cent. of the increase of the population under the age
of five was due to births in the permanent portion of the population, and 65 per cent.
due to the movement of the migratory portion; also, that 38 per cent. of the increase
of population at all ages was due to excess of births over deaths, leaving 62 per cent.

no worse with regard to abortion than many other portions of the country, but
that its registration is conducted with greater care. From the statistics given it
may easily be surmised what the amount of this crime <i>must be elsewhere</i>. It is necessarily
of infinitely more common occurrence than infanticide, the murder of
children after birth, for proof of the frequency of which, at the present moment, in
Great Britain, we refer to Dr. Burke Ryan’s Fothergillian Essay on the subject in

the Health Department of the City of New York has appeared, and we find that
our statements regarding the frequency of the crime in the metropolis are fully corroborated.
Not merely are additional official statistics on this point given (pp. 182,
183), but valuable testimony from Drs. Griscom (pp. 25, 30), McNulty (p. 55), Francis
(p. 64), and Bulkley (p. 133). Dr. Reese’s paper on Infant Mortality, republished
by the Committee (pp. 90-100), from the Transactions of the American Medical
Association for 1857, also contains incidental reference to the frequency of
abortion, and for its direct and earnest dealing with the subject deserves unqualified
commendation.</p>

<p>In this connection we would call attention to the evidence of the extent of the
crime in Boston, afforded since our own remarks upon that point were in type, by
Dr. Walter Channing. (Boston Med. and Surg. Journal, March 17, 1859.)</p>

is nevertheless strictly true. Through the kindness of Bishop Fitzpatrick I have
been favored with a copy of <span class="smcap">Barry</span>’s Medico-Christian Embryology, as presenting
upon this point the authorized and generally received doctrine of the Catholic Church.
I quote the following from the chapter “On Baptism in Impracticable and Difficult
Labors:”</p>

<p>“In case of impacted head and at all times that one is obliged to apply the forceps,
whether at one of the straits or in the pelvic excavation, it becomes necessary to
baptize the child on the part which presents at the uterine orifice after the rupture
of the bag containing the waters.</p>

<p>“In order to baptize the child, a syringe charged with natural water may be used.
If this be not at hand, a person may use a sponge, or a linen or cotton rag, wetted
with water, which is to be carried to the child by the fingers, a pair of forceps, or
any other suitable contrivance, and then squeezed or pressed on the surface of the
part presenting.” (Loc. cit., p. 45.)</p>

<p>“Any person, whether man, woman or child, may baptize an infant when in danger
of death.” (Ibid., p. 76.)</p>

<p>If the facts now stated should be generally known and acted upon by the profession,
hundreds of lives, infant and maternal, would annually be saved.</p>

hostile to all crime. So great, however, is the popular ignorance
regarding this offence, that an abstract morality is here comparatively powerless;
and there can be no doubt that the Romish ordinance, flanked on the one hand by
the confessional, and by denouncement and excommunication on the other, has saved
to the world thousands of infant lives.</p>

<p>I have lately contrived an instrument very similar to one not long since proposed
by Spencer Wells for dilatation of the female urethra, which by a simple combination
of the three principles involved, will probably prove of material service in
the induction of premature labor. It may be called the uterine dilator, as it possesses
many advantages over expansible tents for all cases of uterine disease where
dilatation is necessary, either for diagnosis or treatment. A description of the instrument,
and of its first application to obstetric practice, is published in the current
number of the American Journal of the Medical Sciences.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="label">[199]</a> We have already commented upon the phraseology of the Louisiana statute.
The latitude of its first clause is shown by the context to have been unintentional, and
therefore hardly justifies a change in its classification. The second section of the
Statute of Washington Territory, however, is closely analogous to that now given;
while the final sections of the statutes both of New York and Wisconsin, which make
it penal for a woman voluntarily to effect or submit to the unjustifiable induction of
abortion, are equally silent regarding proof of the existence of pregnancy.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_243" href="#FNanchor_243" class="label">[243]</a> “An efficient, and practical remedy for the prevention of this crime would be a
law requiring the causes of death to be certified by the physician in attendance, or
where there has been no physician, by one called in for the purpose. In this way
the cause of death, both in infants and mothers, could be traced to attempts to procure
abortion. In three cases which occurred in Boston, in 1855, the death was
reported by friends to be owing to natural causes, and in each it was subsequently
ascertained that the patient died in consequence of injuries received in procuring
abortion. It is probable that such cases are by no means rare; and if the cause of
death were known, an immediate investigation might lead to the detection of the
guilty party.” (Boston Med. and Surg. Journal, Dec., 1857, p. 365.)</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
